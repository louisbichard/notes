As you may tell, one of my favourite pastimes is analysis. I love psychoanalysis. What motivates people to do what they do? Psychology is a deep and mind-blowingly intersting tool and power. All the different approaches atheletes takes to weightlifting regarding their arousal level when they take their lifts to their conduct in training through to their attitudes to other work and their home life. I've seen some guys look like they're about to have an aneuirism while they're training, using pure frustration and rage to attack what they're doing, whilst I personally like to be as calm as humanly possible whilst performing maximally; for me, this is more sustainable (and far more enjoyable!).

This kind of analysis however is prevalent across the best of the best in any field. They not only perform well, but they know WHY they perform well. The sooner you know your strengths and weakenesses and are open and honest with yourself the better. 

I do feel however that post-analysis is considerably more important than peri-analysis. What I mean is that when you're performing any act, may it be writing some code, or pulling a weight, don't analyse yourself in the moment, let yourself naturally flow as you would and then analyse after the action has been performed and use this as your cue going forward. By taking time during to try and analyse can really take away from the job at hand, don't bother with this, it's really not worth it, there's very little you can do in the short term. 

Be the coach, and not the athelete. If you are the athelete then you will always benefit from coaching someone else. A good coach doesn't just tell you what to do, he tells you why to do it, and you too should be asking your mentors, your boss, your colleagues 'why?'. After all as elliot Carver says in Die Another Day

    It is not who, not when but why.

If they consistently refuse to tell you, or pull smoke and mirrors and don't just admit they don't know the answer, run. Yous should find yourself asking questions like. Why did you assign me this task? Why did you pick me for this job, why _didn't_ you pick me for this job? on a daily basis. 

    You are what you repeatedly do

Take this analysis, find what is good and repeat it, and drill away at your weaknesses, repeat and become what you repeatedly do.
