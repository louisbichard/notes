The right time for Parkinson 
============================

It's said for a start up that if your product feels ready, then you've launched too late. I think the same is true of weightlifters. I don't think there has been a time that I've stepped once onto the platform and felt truly 'ready'. 
    
    It's not about how many good days you have and how you perform on these good days that makes you, it's how you perform on the bad days that makes a true athelete

// TODO: REPLACE WITH REAL QUOTE

 A true athelete can go into training feeling underecovered and tired and do what needs to be done (within reason). They can go in, and have a bad day, they just can't put the numbers up but they switch gears and move to something that makes the most sense in terms of damage limitation. 

I've even seen it when I used to work with children when my boss reminded me that anyone can be a good teacher to the good kids, it's how you deal with the bad ones, the ones that you don't like that separates the men from the boys. 

With that in mind, I feel it is __imperative__ and non-negotiable to have goals and to test yourself frequently. Without a current measure of your current output, how can you ever know what to expect from yourself? How will you ever have something to keep you accountible?

_Parkinsons law_ states that any task will expand to fill the time you've allocated it. The best time I see parksinsons law is when you're cooking something in the microwave. Notice just how much you can get done in that 2 minutes before the ping goes off? I bet you can clean 10 plates, dry them, sweep the floor, put in some veg to cook and then some in that time. It is by this same principle that you must ensure that incrementally measure your success. Pick a target within reason for the next few months, annonunce it on social media if you have to keep yourself accountible, and then get to work. 

The more the deadline scares you, the better.
