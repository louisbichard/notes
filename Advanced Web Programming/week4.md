# Tokenisation 

## Lexical analysis
- Splitting up the programming code into tokens
- Tokens are defined as independent pieces of the code
- Code comments are not counted as tokens

# Fixed tokens vs Programmer defined
- Fixed tokens:
    + `function`, `var` etc
    + These are set and are specific values that never change
    + Broken down into:
        * Reserved words
        * Operators
        * Brackets
        * Punctuation
- Programmer defined tokens
    + `"test"` `0239494` 
    + These are programmer defiend and tend to be variable in length or size
    + Can be broken down into:
        * Identifier (function identifiers, parameter identifiers and variable identifiers)
        * Constants
