#Background to domestic violence

#History of the women rights movement and domestic rights historically

##Opinions matter

Opinions matter is "research conducted to identify peoples attitudes towards rape and sexual assault" (Opinion matters, 2010). The survey was a random sample of 1061 people in London between the ages of 18 - 50 

From a survey on 1061 random Londoners, the organisation Opinion matters found that when asked whether they would report a case of sexual assault to the police 20% of respondent said either definitely 'no' or 'maybe'. Out of these respondnets the reasons for their uncertainty in reporting the crime was because they would be too embarassed, would want to forget it ever happened, wouldn't want to go to court, would be afraid of repercussions or would be afraid that their family might find out (Opinion matters, 2010). From this research it can be deduced that a large amount of sexual offences go undetected and are simply unknown to the police.

#Technology

##Problems with current technologies

Currently there is a gap in the market hwere social or care workers who have the knowledge surrounding the sensitive areas of domestic violence do not have enought or relevant access to resources that could help them to create powerful applications to solve issues in their domain. 

##Evaluation of technologies

Because of the gap between abilities to create technology and wealth of knowledge of the business domain websites such as _techsafety.org_ have been spawned to 'evaluate' technologies that emerge to assess their successes. Tech safety provide documenation on how to create applications that fit the needs of the domestic violence market assessing criterion such as:

__Data usage, storage and policies__: How secure the data is that the organisation hold, and their ability to purge or justify the need for stored data.

__Connecting with survivors policies__: Communication is sensitive when it comes to victims of violent crime. Care must be taken when communicating. Are email addresses sent with obvious names that would alert an abuser to the scheme? Are voicemails left on phones of those that are at risk of them being listened to by the abuser. 

__Ability to deliver on promises__: This is particularly relevant to mobile applications. If services are offering direct communication with emergency services, the application must run as close to 100% of the time as possible.
