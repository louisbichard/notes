##Notes from mums email
 
* We talked about personalisation, really worth looking at and how this has been applied.
* Social Return on Investment in relation to evaluation, Susan went on the course with me so she has some understanding of the approach too.
* We talked a lot about visible recovery it is worth looking at how this applies to victims, there is a real link to building resilience and aftercare.
* WIFI is a big lottery approach using “navigators” for the service user.
