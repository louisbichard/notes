# NOTES FROM THE LECTURE
========================

* Potentially the 3rd and 4th markers will NEVER see the applicaiton, therefore they need to get everything through the report
* Report is ultimately what sells the project, so needs to be a lot of the effort
* Include lots of infographics
* Use figures and lists where necessary
* Should have some original content (i.e not just all references)
* Identify the purpose of the report 
    - Who it's for
    - Why they should be interested
    - What should be done as a result
* Show usage of the course in the report
* Justifications of decisions
    - Project management styles
    - Delivery style
* Show the approach and methods and decisions used and taken when undertaking the project report
* Find out the tense that the supervisor wants (I, We, Third person) (Passive, active 1st person, active third person)
* Ensure that everything is in present tense, not in the future tense, i.e chapter five 'will' (wrong) cover something.
* Ensure that each stage is justified and then evaluated
    - Why did you choose any language
    - Was the decision good
* Ensure that all figures are numbered (and then refer to them by number)
    - Including code blocks with numbers
    - Refer to the code blocks by number
* Try to structure it so that there are no more than 3 levels
* Graphs and tables instead of typed data
* Number all figures
* Titles should be at the top of tables, and the bottom of diagrams
* Ensure that everything has a reference or is justified or proven by research
* Ensure that you don't make binary statements such as 'You MUST do this to get THIS'
    - Search for words such as 'vital', 'essential' etc as these might be sweeping
* Each chapter should have a scope at the start (and summary)
    - Discuss what the section will say and what is and isn't covered
    - State which objectives are satisfied with the chapter
    - "This section reviewed blah blah blah"
    - What has been covered in the chapter
    - Connect chapters if necessary

    + Why did you do it, what did you do, what happened, what were the outcomes
    + Ensure that those that only read the abstract are able to draw as much information as necessary from it
    + Simply copy and paste the conclusion and then edit it to be better for the abstract
- Key words
    + Not essential

    + Background to the problem

- Literature review
    + Is about what other people say
    + do 
- Main sections
- Conclusion
