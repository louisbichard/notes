"This research was commissioned to identify people’s attitudes towards rape and sexual assault so that we could have a better understanding of the emotional barriers which prevent people from being able to access support when they have experienced sexual violence."

"Opinion Matters surveyed a random sample of 1061 people in London aged 18 to 50 online.
The sample includes 349 men, 712 women, 213 aged 18 to 24, 386 aged 25 to 34 and 462
aged 35 to 50. The sample also included 922 heterosexual, 71 homosexual, 52 bisexual and
16 asexual respondents."

"Almost a half of Londoners have walked home via back streets on their own months (46%)
 Over a quarter have left a drink unattended in a bar (26%)
 One in five has been so drunk they have lost their memory of an evening (20%)
 One in five have got into a taxi without checking that is it licensed (20%)"

"The 25 to 34 year olds are most likely in the last 12 months to have:
 Left a drink unattended at a bar (31% vs. 21% of 35 to 50 year olds)
 Been so drunk they have lost their memory of the evening (26% vs. 14% of 35 to 50 year olds)"

"When asked specifically about reporting a sexual assault or rape to the police a significant
number of respondents were unsure:
 Over one in ten claimed they would ‘maybe’ report it to the police (13%) and one in twenty admitted they didn’t know (5%)  One in fifty respondents were clear that they would not report a case of rape or sexual assault to the police (2%)""

"This begs the question; why? What is it that prevents people from letting the police know?
The main reasons are:
 I would be too embarrassed / ashamed of what had happened (55%)
 I would just want to forget it ever happened (41%)
 I wouldn’t want to go to court (38%)
 I would be afraid of repercussions from the assailant (31%)
 I would be afraid that my family would find out (25%)"


Some open responses to this question were:
“The rape conviction rate here is the lowest in Europe. I wouldn't want to relive the experience in
court, and have to be in the same room as my assaulter, considering the odds of getting a
conviction are so low. Prison time is so low even if a conviction”
“I would be afraid of being demoralised by the police and society during court proceedings, why
bother when they are just going to get off the charges anyway?”
“I am not sure whether I would be taken seriously and the follow through procedure would be
thorough”
“My statement of truth being doubted”
“Rape victims rarely get justice”

Although Londoners would not report a rape or assault on themselves, they would
however offer advice to a friend if they had confided in them about such an assault.
 The vast majority of Londoners would advise their friends to seek immediate medical
attention if they had been sexually assaulted (96%)

Shockingly, over a third of Londoners have been in a situation where they could have
been made to have sex when they didn’t want to (34%)
 Women are twice as likely as men to have been in this situation (40% vs. 20%)

Women are less forgiving than men. They are more likely to think that a person should
accept responsibility when:
 Performing another sexual act on them (75% vs. 70%)
 Getting into bed with a person (71% vs. 57%)
 Going back to theirs for a drink (35% vs. 19%)
 Dressing provocatively (31% vs. 23%)
 Dancing in a sexy way with a man at a night club or bar (23% vs. 19%)
 Accepting a drink and engaging in a conversation at a bar (15% vs. 11%)

"The weight of the literature seems to suggest that
mandatory arrest policies may not universally achieve positive goals. Moreover,
some studies show that police agencies do not work effectively with
other social welfare agencies"

Future research should seek alternative police
interventions that yield more integrated methods for societal response to domestic
violence

"Domestic violence is a social problem that has increasingly been targeted
as a phenomenon in need of social control. At the forefront of this issue is the
debate surrounding the role police play in their response to domestic violence"

#Page 2

s. And yet, this issue continues
to spark controversy and debate among experts over the use of arrest by the
police as a means and a solution for the social control of domestic violence

##Page 3

"Since most domestic violence cases were classified as misdemeanor assaults, police officers were gravely restricted as to when they could employ arrest. Until recently, most states had restrictions in place on the use of warrantless misdemeanor arrests"

"Many officers regarded domestic violence incidents as private disputes that should be settled by the parties involved. Thus, police were more likely to resort to a policy that did not criminalize the action."

##Page 4

"With the feminist and women’s rights movements that began in the late 1960s, popular consciousness about societal neglect toward problems of women, such as rape, was raised."

"Although initially focused on crimes involving strangers, women’s rights activists soon began to contemplate the question of violence in the home. As batteredwomen’s shelters began to open around the country, more attorneys, victims’advocates, and social workers became involved in cases of domestic violence."

##Page 5

"A final element involved in motivation for change in the criminal justice system’s response to domestic violence was the increasing number of studies and research projects devoted to addressing issues involved with domestic violence"

"The Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment, published in 1984 by Lawrence Sherman and Richard Berk, has proven to be the most influential study on policy change in regards to police response to domestic violence."

##Page 8

"Furthermore, many of the studies would evaluate a situation as successful if no further violence occurs. But, this does not consider that chance that perhaps the offender is no longer physically abusive, but continues to be verbally abusive."


"Many victims may prefer to stay in an abusive relationship rather than lose financial support or lose their children."

##Page 9

"Studies have found that one of the major reasons victims do not call the police is because they do see their battering as a private or personal matter"

"The impact of arrest may depend on the situation of the victim. If the family is dependent on the offender for financial support, the intervention of arrest may be detrimental to the family or the victim, but for a victim where this is not the case, arrest may have a different effect."

##Page 10

"Mandatory arrest, therefore, may actually work against empowering the victims because it removes the power from the victim. Moreover, this could have negative long-term consequences."

##Page 14

"Third, along with mediation, police officers may use referrals. They may recommend that victim or offender seek professional help, or offer referrals to social agencies or legal aid. "

"Finally, police continue to use the response of no action at all. Some officers may leave the scene almost immediately."

"One major problem with the studies, in terms of both separation and mediation, is that in studies the officers did not receive any specific trainingin regards how to separate or mediate in domestic violence situations. I"

##Page 16 

"Although it is unlikely that this will occur, it appears that arrest in certain situations does not deter future violence and may even backfire. Thus, each situation needs to be looked at differentially."

"Finally, special units and policies should focus on chronically violent couples. A limited number of couples produce the most domestic violence."

"focus more on proactive problem-solving than reactive crime-fighting."

##Page 17 

"If we are going to ask police to take on the role of ‘‘social work,’’ we must give them the skills and ability to be sensitized to the issues involved and different methods available for them to do so."

"Furthermore, research has shown that many offenders of domestic violence will be violent in all of their future relationships. Thus, even though the domestic violence incident may result in the termination of the relationship between offender and the victim, the offender still needs to receive help."

"In conclusion, police are not the solution to the problem of domestic violence. Instead, they play a role in the controlling of domestic violence."

"The most important thing a police officer can hope to accomplish, besides stopping the immediate danger, is to issue referrals and to create an awareness among both victims and offenders that there are people and agencies that can help."

"This introduction to agencies may be the first step in many people’s lives in breaking the cycle of domestic abuse."

"There is no question that in certain cases of domestic violence, arrest is the only viable option, but mandating arrest may have some grave consequences. Thus, it should not be the recommended policy."

#Secondary sources

"The development of an effective policy to deal with chronically violent couples may have more impact than anything else (Schmidt and Sherman, 1993)."

"Schmidt and Sherman (1993) put forth the following policy recommendations. First, mandatory arrest laws should be repealed, especially in areas of high poverty populations and high unemployment rates."

"They found officers reported making referrals to the following places: women victims’ hot lines (44.3% of the time), private complaint programs (14.2%), battered-women’s shelters (10.5%), clergy (9%), court (7.1%), and miscellaneous other places all less than 6.5% of the time (Belknap and McCall, 1994)."

"Police response to domestic violence needs to be refocused to go beyond whether they arrest or not, but to include whether they give referrals to social services agencies that may be useful to victims, offenders, and children living within an abusive environment (Belknap and McCall, 1994)."

"Belknap and McCall (1994) explored this, looking at the number of referrals police give,the types of police referrals, and how police officers’ personal characteristicsare related to the referrals that they give"

"Second, mediation is a common response of police in cases of domestic violence. Mediation includes a variety of differentverbal responses. Officers may talk to the offender and the victim in sympatheticor unsympathetic manner (Walker, 1992)."

"They concluded that this was due, in part, to the fact that victims who sustained serious injuries were more likely to report the incident to police (60% to 51%), victims who had not previously been victimized were more likely to report the incident to police (62% to 54%), and that black victims were more likely than white to report the incident to police (71% to 55%) (Bachman and Coker, 1995)."

"Mignon and Holmes (1995) found that the decision to arrest was affected by injury to the victim, use of a weapon, and presence of a witness."

"And, it gives women who are ready to leave their abusive partner the time to find somewhere else to go or to get a protective order (Starks, 1993)."

"Manning (1993) argues that arresting batterers will target minorities and people from low socioeconomic backgrounds since arrests in domestic violence cases are disproportionately of lower class,"

"Many victims do not actually want the offender arrested, but rather want to control the immediate situation--stop the violence at that time (Gelles, 1993)."

"Finally, Sherman (1993) puts forth the following summary of conclusions from the domestic violence research on police use of arrest: (1) arrest reduces violence in some cities, but increases it in others, (2) arrest reduces domestic violence among employed people, but increases it among unemployed people, (3) arrest reduces domestic violence in the short run, but can increase it in the long run, and (4) police can predict which couples are most likely to suffer future violence, but our society values privacy too highly to encourage preventive action"

"Williams and Hawkins’ (1989) analysis concluded that arrest works as a deterrent, but only for those who have something to lose"

 "Crimes that are economically motivated or require intense planning seem to be more receptive to deterrence than ‘‘noneconomic crimes in general and crimes involving the impulsive, explosive use of violence typical in domestic violence assaults’’ (Buzawa, 1990)"

"If arrest is practiced for the purpose of deterring recidivism among domestic violence offenders, research has shown that it is not universally and consistently achieving its goal. The strength of deterrence may vary in accordance with the nature of the offense (Gelles, 1993)."

"McCord (1992) argues that prior research has shown that multiple victimization is common and that those who are violent in one relationship tend to be violent in others."

"The Minneapolis experiment found that within the six-month follow-up period after police intervention, the arrested offenders had the lowest recidivism rates (10%) against the Downloaded by [Loughborough University] at 06:43 16 December 2014 6 JOURNAL OF OFFENDER REHABILITATION same victim (Gelles, 1993).This indicated that arrest appeared to prevent repeated domestic violence more effectively than either separation or mediation. This led the researchers to recommend that states change laws prohibiting police from making warrantless arrests in misdemeanor domestic violence cases and that some form of arrest policy be implemented (Sherman and Schmidt, 1993)."

"Berk (1980) states that police often provide inadequate documentation
of domestic violence incidents, which results in hindering any further action
by the criminal justice system."

"The term ‘‘rule of thumb’’ comes from British Common
Law which allowed men legally to beat their wives with sticks no bigger
than their thumb, citing that anything bigger would be too uncivilized
(Brown, 1984)"

In the twentieth century, the traditional police response to cases of domestic
violence has been dominated by their ‘‘overriding goal to extricate (themselves)
from the dangerous and unpleasant duty with as little cost as possible
and to reinvolve (themselves) with ‘real’ police work’’ (Buzawa, 1990).

"Historically, all over the world laws have been in place that condoned domestic
violence by a man against his wife. In 1140, the first systematization of
church law specified that ‘‘women were ‘subject to their men’ and needed to
be corrected through castigation or punishment’’ (Dutton, 1995)."

Berk (1980) states that police often provide inadequate documentation
of domestic violence incidents, which results in hindering any further action
by the criminal justice system. S
