“There is an increasing amount of stalking and harrassing through internet and other technologies, and they are now key ways in which domestic and sexual violence is perpetrated. I think it’s easy to underestimate the fear that this form of abuse can create, and it is important that people come to acknowledge this. We are pleased to see that national Women's Aid have developed a tool for helping organisations like ours to support victims of cyber abuse. We will continue to work, as a local charity providing support for victims of sexual and domestic violence, to raise awareness on forms of abuse perpetrated through the internet.”

"It was not long before Ruth had need of the new mobile, when her husband flew into yet another violent rage. Unbeknown to him, she pressed the button and the call alerted the police to her location. Within minutes, officers were on the scene and the years of abuse finally drew to a close." 

"Ruth is one of more than 2,000 women in this country who have used these mobiles. Known as TecSOS phones, they were developed by the Vodafone Foundation - the philanthropic arm of mobile phone giant, Vodafone. First used in Spain six years ago, the phones are now being used by police forces in Italy, Portugal, Hungary and the UK."

"Statistics suggest that on average, two women a week are killed by a current or former partner while one in four women will experience domestic violence in their lifetime."

"One of the tactics police use is a static alarm based in a victim’s home,” said Liversidge. “The problem with it is the victim gets used to having this blanket of safety so they’re loath to leave home. Inadvertently, you make victims prisoners in their own home. Suddenly, this phone allows you to go out and about and bit by bit, they get their self confidence back."

"Participants will be given tools and information to respond to technology abuse, to enhance services for survivors of violence, and to hold offenders accountable. In addition to incredible attendees from all over the United States and internationally, our excellent faculty includes the Safety Net Team; survivors; national experts on technology, confidentiality, and privacy’ technology developers  and representatives from technology companies; and leaders in law enforcement, domestic violence, and the legal field.

###Page 1

"Is it possible, for
example, to use crowdsourcing, or combinations of social
networks, the web and mobile phones to “fight crime”, as Luis
Von Ahn1
has suggested?" 

###Page 2

"Other forms of data gathering occur
through victim surveys, such as the British Crime Survey,
(B.C.S.) suggesting a “dark figure” of unrecorded crime."

"It is recognised that “official” U.K. crime data is problematic, and
that the trust of communities in the police needs rebuilding, so
that “information about crime flows from the community to the
police."

"With the technology now available, can we address these
problems? Researchers from The Korean Advanced Institute of
Science and Technology (KAIST) have an app in development –
Risk Alert - that allows the crowdsourcing of reports on crime and
that allows gradual and victim-led levels of disclosure, as opposed
to the (mostly) one-size-fits-all I.C.O. data protection paradigm."

"Risk Alert uses open data sources, such as crime open data, to
supplement environmental information provided by users:
showing floating population, hospitals, police stations, CCTV.
Risk Alert shows a mapped location-based environmental risk
score, and enables reporting of violence, harassment or
threatening behaviour either to police, friends or family."

"Without actually deploying this system, we can imagine that it
could very easily be used to crowdsource data, while allowing
victims control over the process of disclosure – this system is
analogue, rather than the digital “either-it-is-a-crime-or-it-isn‟t” of
the formalised reporting system that feeds U.K. open crime data."

"We must consider risk - such a reporting architecture could be dangerous, if
identities were leaked, lost or let slip."

"It would be open to trolls, to false
reports, and the risk of vigilantism. Some of these issues could be
addressed by the use of forensic linguistic analysis and machine
learning techniques to check for unusual patterns of activity, or
for one voice submitting multiple reports."

###Page 3

"It would enable the building
of trust in the reporting system; trust is a key concept with
reporting some crimes."

Police may
feel that dominant problems in a neighbourhood are car crime and
burglary, while sexual assault, domestic violence and similar
crimes remain under-reported. [10] “

For example, in contrast to open police crime data, victim surveys
show that only 15% of victims report to the police and that of
reported crimes, conviction rates are around 30%. Five per cent of
females have been victims of a serious sexual offence since they
were 16, 20% have been a victim of some sexual offence since
they were 16 and 2.5% of females and 0.4% of males had been
victims of sexual offences in the previous 12 months. [13]

#Aspire news app

"The Aspire News app looks like any other iPhone or Android news aggregator, but it’s actually a potentially lifesaving domestic violence alert system."

"While the front page functions like a regular news app, when you go to the “Help” section of the page it provides a list of local domestic violence resources and a “Go Button,” that, once pressed, alerts the user’s chosen contacts, local authorities and service providers about the violent or potentially violent situation."

"It’s a simple idea, but a potentially lifesaving one. People in situations of abuse often have their phone and online activity monitored by their abusers, so having an app that can help someone get help without the abuser’s notice could serve as a lifeline for someone in danger. And best of all, it’s completely free."


##Domestic violence apps

__Source__: http://www.notimpossiblenow.com/lives/apps-for-domestic-violence-victims-put-to-the-test

"While many mobile apps are available to help victims of domestic violence, there are many tools for abusers to spy on their victims. While most creators of apps designed for abuse victims are careful not to give them obvious names that would send a red flag to abusers who check their victim’s emails, texts and browser histories, they also need to consider other factors in designing apps so that they work properly when they are needed."

##Notes from interview with Cindy Southworth
"Cindy Southworth: We’re creating an application safety center where we provide information for practitioners and domestic violence survivors about the new emergence of smartphone apps that are being developed. Some of them are educational. Some of them are signs and tips of what to look for. Is a relationship controlling?"

“How is this app designed if the survivor wanted to use the app? What are some of the safety things to consider beyond the obvious, such as you have an app on your phone that your abuser is checking 24 hours a day?”

"Also, some of the apps collect personal information, which we have concerns about. We want to say, “If you’re using this app, be sure you’re aware of what you’re consenting to share, where it’s going and why you’d be giving it over.” There are great creative apps out there, but we want to help people navigate the landscape because there are so many of them."

"Cindy: Survivors, practitioners (shelters, victims’ advocates, etc.) and bystanders (friends, family, interested community members)."

"We also take a look at how it’s designed, [if there is] full and informed consent and is it making promises to the victim that can’t be backed up."

"If you download an app that promises to contact your friends (in the event of a domestic violence emergency), make sure you’ve tested it multiple times, and especially after you do an operating system update. Every time there’s an OS update, things get glitchy."

"Has the Ray Rice incident brought domestic violence into focus? Cindy: Absolutely. It’s been all over social media and people are engaging on a more nuanced discussion of the issues than I’ve ever seen in all my years of this work."

"Where do you see in terms of technology in being a tool or aid in helping victims? Cindy: Technology itself will not end domestic violence. However, technology can be used as a tool that aids communities to stand up and speak out via social media platforms."
