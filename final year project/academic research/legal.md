##Data Purging

* When record retention lengths are not mandated by any law or licensure regulation, it is best practice to have a policy of purging records regularly to delete any detailed information that is no longer needed. 
* Survivors lives and circumstances change. 
* Purging data regularly protects their confidentiality and ensures that you are not retaining or acting upon outdated or inaccurate information. 
* For example, when a victim first comes to shelter, you may need to document what s/he requests, such as housing or counseling or other specific requests. 
* After the survivor leaves shelter, all you may need is a record that services were provided by the program. * Purging detailed information in records could be done every 3 months or whenever a survivor leaves the program.
* Again, if minimal information is collected in the first place, purging unnecessary information from the file later will be easier

##Data justification and reasoning

* Your agency’s data retention policies should coexist seamlessly with your agency’s data collection policies and at a minimum cover:
	* What records you collect related to a victim (and related children).
	* Why you collect the records that you do. Demonstrate a clear need or rationale.
	* How records such as intakes and case notes are kept.
	* What type of data is entered into any file or database (e.g. date of birth versus age range)
	* What the process is for consenting to or opting out of being entered into a database or file.
	* How someone can request to see or request edits to a record about them.
	* The length of time specific records will be kept.
	* The process for purging data, including how paper and electronic data are securely destroyed, and, how and when inaccurate and outdated data gets automatically or manually deleted.
	* What data will be purged versus what data will remain and for how long (time frames).
	* How records are separated or restricted to address privilege or licensure record retention laws or regulations.
	* Which types of records your record retention policy pertains to.
	* Access levels: who can access what data, and how access is changed or revoked.
	* How any records you retain are stored securely until they are destroyed.

##Access to data

* Data retention policies should include a process for identifying and setting access levels. Because data collected in programs is confidential and contains sensitive information of individual survivors, agencies should establish who can have access and view that data. For example, the database can be set up so that a volunteer, intern, or certain staff who do not work directly with survivors can only pull aggregate data (i.e., how many people were served with a particular service within a time period) rather than individually identifying information. Just like some paper records are kept locked up with only senior staff having access, access levels on data being retained in databases helps maintain confidentiality.
