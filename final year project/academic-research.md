"Is it possible, for
example, to use crowdsourcing, or combinations of social
networks, the web and mobile phones to “fight crime”, as Luis
Von Ahn1
has suggested?" 

###Page 2

"Other forms of data gathering occur
through victim surveys, such as the British Crime Survey,
(B.C.S.) suggesting a “dark figure” of unrecorded crime."

"It is recognised that “official” U.K. crime data is problematic, and
that the trust of communities in the police needs rebuilding, so
that “information about crime flows from the community to the
police."

"With the technology now available, can we address these
problems? Researchers from The Korean Advanced Institute of
Science and Technology (KAIST) have an app in development –
Risk Alert - that allows the crowdsourcing of reports on crime and
that allows gradual and victim-led levels of disclosure, as opposed
to the (mostly) one-size-fits-all I.C.O. data protection paradigm."

"Risk Alert uses open data sources, such as crime open data, to
supplement environmental information provided by users:
showing floating population, hospitals, police stations, CCTV.
Risk Alert shows a mapped location-based environmental risk
score, and enables reporting of violence, harassment or
threatening behaviour either to police, friends or family."

"Without actually deploying this system, we can imagine that it
could very easily be used to crowdsource data, while allowing
victims control over the process of disclosure – this system is
analogue, rather than the digital “either-it-is-a-crime-or-it-isn‟t” of
the formalised reporting system that feeds U.K. open crime data."

"We must consider risk - such a reporting architecture could be dangerous, if
identities were leaked, lost or let slip."

"It would be open to trolls, to false
reports, and the risk of vigilantism. Some of these issues could be
addressed by the use of forensic linguistic analysis and machine
learning techniques to check for unusual patterns of activity, or
for one voice submitting multiple reports."

"It would enable the building
of trust in the reporting system; trust is a key concept with
reporting some crimes."

Police may
feel that dominant problems in a neighbourhood are car crime and
burglary, while sexual assault, domestic violence and similar
crimes remain under-reported. [10] “

For example, in contrast to open police crime data, victim surveys
show that only 15% of victims report to the police and that of
reported crimes, conviction rates are around 30%. Five per cent of
females have been victims of a serious sexual offence since they
were 16, 20% have been a victim of some sexual offence since
they were 16 and 2.5% of females and 0.4% of males had been
victims of sexual offences in the previous 12 months. [13]

#Wake up to rape research

_Wake Up To Rape Research Summary Report Prepared By: Opinion Matters Prepared For:The Havens (Sexual Assault Referral Centres)_

__Reference:__

"This research was commissioned to identify people’s attitudes towards rape and sexual assault so that we could have a better understanding of the emotional barriers which prevent people from being able to access support when they have experienced sexual violence."

"Opinion Matters surveyed a random sample of 1061 people in London aged 18 to 50 online.
The sample includes 349 men, 712 women, 213 aged 18 to 24, 386 aged 25 to 34 and 462
aged 35 to 50. The sample also included 922 heterosexual, 71 homosexual, 52 bisexual and
16 asexual respondents."

"Almost a half of Londoners have walked home via back streets on their own months (46%)
 Over a quarter have left a drink unattended in a bar (26%)
 One in five has been so drunk they have lost their memory of an evening (20%)
 One in five have got into a taxi without checking that is it licensed (20%)"

"The 25 to 34 year olds are most likely in the last 12 months to have:
 Left a drink unattended at a bar (31% vs. 21% of 35 to 50 year olds)
 Been so drunk they have lost their memory of the evening (26% vs. 14% of 35 to 50 year olds)"

"When asked specifically about reporting a sexual assault or rape to the police a significant
number of respondents were unsure:
 Over one in ten claimed they would ‘maybe’ report it to the police (13%) and one in twenty admitted they didn’t know (5%)  One in fifty respondents were clear that they would not report a case of rape or sexual assault to the police (2%)""

"This begs the question; why? What is it that prevents people from letting the police know?
The main reasons are:
 I would be too embarrassed / ashamed of what had happened (55%)
 I would just want to forget it ever happened (41%)
 I wouldn’t want to go to court (38%)
 I would be afraid of repercussions from the assailant (31%)
 I would be afraid that my family would find out (25%)"


Some open responses to this question were:
“The rape conviction rate here is the lowest in Europe. I wouldn't want to relive the experience in
court, and have to be in the same room as my assaulter, considering the odds of getting a
conviction are so low. Prison time is so low even if a conviction”
“I would be afraid of being demoralised by the police and society during court proceedings, why
bother when they are just going to get off the charges anyway?”
“I am not sure whether I would be taken seriously and the follow through procedure would be
thorough”
“My statement of truth being doubted”
“Rape victims rarely get justice”

Although Londoners would not report a rape or assault on themselves, they would
however offer advice to a friend if they had confided in them about such an assault.
 The vast majority of Londoners would advise their friends to seek immediate medical
attention if they had been sexually assaulted (96%)

Shockingly, over a third of Londoners have been in a situation where they could have
been made to have sex when they didn’t want to (34%)
 Women are twice as likely as men to have been in this situation (40% vs. 20%)

Women are less forgiving than men. They are more likely to think that a person should
accept responsibility when:
 Performing another sexual act on them (75% vs. 70%)
 Getting into bed with a person (71% vs. 57%)
 Going back to theirs for a drink (35% vs. 19%)
 Dressing provocatively (31% vs. 23%)
 Dancing in a sexy way with a man at a night club or bar (23% vs. 19%)
 Accepting a drink and engaging in a conversation at a bar (15% vs. 11%)

"The weight of the literature seems to suggest that
mandatory arrest policies may not universally achieve positive goals. Moreover,
some studies show that police agencies do not work effectively with
other social welfare agencies"

Future research should seek alternative police
interventions that yield more integrated methods for societal response to domestic
violence

"Domestic violence is a social problem that has increasingly been targeted
as a phenomenon in need of social control. At the forefront of this issue is the
debate surrounding the role police play in their response to domestic violence"

s. And yet, this issue continues
to spark controversy and debate among experts over the use of arrest by the
police as a means and a solution for the social control of domestic violence



#Secondary sources

"Berk (1980) states that police often provide inadequate documentation
of domestic violence incidents, which results in hindering any further action
by the criminal justice system."

"The term ‘‘rule of thumb’’ comes from British Common
Law which allowed men legally to beat their wives with sticks no bigger
than their thumb, citing that anything bigger would be too uncivilized
(Brown, 1984)"

In the twentieth century, the traditional police response to cases of domestic
violence has been dominated by their ‘‘overriding goal to extricate (themselves)
from the dangerous and unpleasant duty with as little cost as possible
and to reinvolve (themselves) with ‘real’ police work’’ (Buzawa, 1990).

"Historically, all over the world laws have been in place that condoned domestic
violence by a man against his wife. In 1140, the first systematization of
church law specified that ‘‘women were ‘subject to their men’ and needed to
be corrected through castigation or punishment’’ (Dutton, 1995)."
