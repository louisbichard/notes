"Is it possible, for
example, to use crowdsourcing, or combinations of social
networks, the web and mobile phones to “fight crime”, as Luis
Von Ahn1
has suggested?" 

###Page 2

"Other forms of data gathering occur
through victim surveys, such as the British Crime Survey,
(B.C.S.) suggesting a “dark figure” of unrecorded crime."

"It is recognised that “official” U.K. crime data is problematic, and
that the trust of communities in the police needs rebuilding, so
that “information about crime flows from the community to the
police."

"With the technology now available, can we address these
problems? Researchers from The Korean Advanced Institute of
Science and Technology (KAIST) have an app in development –
Risk Alert - that allows the crowdsourcing of reports on crime and
that allows gradual and victim-led levels of disclosure, as opposed
to the (mostly) one-size-fits-all I.C.O. data protection paradigm."

"Risk Alert uses open data sources, such as crime open data, to
supplement environmental information provided by users:
showing floating population, hospitals, police stations, CCTV.
Risk Alert shows a mapped location-based environmental risk
score, and enables reporting of violence, harassment or
threatening behaviour either to police, friends or family."

"Without actually deploying this system, we can imagine that it
could very easily be used to crowdsource data, while allowing
victims control over the process of disclosure – this system is
analogue, rather than the digital “either-it-is-a-crime-or-it-isn‟t” of
the formalised reporting system that feeds U.K. open crime data."

"We must consider risk - such a reporting architecture could be dangerous, if
identities were leaked, lost or let slip."

"It would be open to trolls, to false
reports, and the risk of vigilantism. Some of these issues could be
addressed by the use of forensic linguistic analysis and machine
learning techniques to check for unusual patterns of activity, or
for one voice submitting multiple reports."

"It would enable the building
of trust in the reporting system; trust is a key concept with
reporting some crimes."

Police may
feel that dominant problems in a neighbourhood are car crime and
burglary, while sexual assault, domestic violence and similar
crimes remain under-reported. [10] “

For example, in contrast to open police crime data, victim surveys
show that only 15% of victims report to the police and that of
reported crimes, conviction rates are around 30%. Five per cent of
females have been victims of a serious sexual offence since they
were 16, 20% have been a victim of some sexual offence since
they were 16 and 2.5% of females and 0.4% of males had been
victims of sexual offences in the previous 12 months. [13]

To return to our
thought experiment, and the app, we know that self-identification
increase a victim‟s feeling of threat [1][14]

_Wake Up To Rape Research Summary Report Prepared By: Opinion Matters Prepared For:The Havens (Sexual Assault Referral Centres)_

"This research was commissioned to identify people’s attitudes towards rape and sexual assault so that we could have a better understanding of the emotional barriers which prevent people from being able to access support when they have experienced sexual violence."

"Opinion Matters surveyed a random sample of 1061 people in London aged 18 to 50 online.
The sample includes 349 men, 712 women, 213 aged 18 to 24, 386 aged 25 to 34 and 462
aged 35 to 50. The sample also included 922 heterosexual, 71 homosexual, 52 bisexual and
16 asexual respondents."

"Almost a half of Londoners have walked home via back streets on their own months (46%)
 Over a quarter have left a drink unattended in a bar (26%)
 One in five has been so drunk they have lost their memory of an evening (20%)
 One in five have got into a taxi without checking that is it licensed (20%)"

"The 25 to 34 year olds are most likely in the last 12 months to have:
 Left a drink unattended at a bar (31% vs. 21% of 35 to 50 year olds)
 Been so drunk they have lost their memory of the evening (26% vs. 14% of 35 to 50 year olds)"
