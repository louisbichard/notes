- Improvement driven
- Spend time out of the gym
- Very very analytical (always asking why)
- A 'little' forgetful, but deal with this through writing everything down
- Weightlifter, powerlifter, yoga, stretching, maintainance, cooking
- Love personal development, personal development books, thinking, want to publish my own e-book soon ( might not be perfect but same concept as weightlifting )
