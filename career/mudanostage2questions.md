- Github URL: http://louisbichard.github.io/absenteeism_booking_2/#/

Goal
====

- Definitely not a final draft, want to identify any glaring flaws
- Address some of the remaining questions and look at some interface considations
- Find out how easy it is for each of the end users, project managers, end users and workstream leads to perform the actions that they require

Questions for clarification
===========================

- Clashes
    + Are they user defined, or system defined, or defined potentially on each search?
    + How is the manager reviewing and addressing these clashes? Through the calendar interface?
    + Could show clashes on hover, and on selection (an icon on clashed bookings or a letter?)
    + Do they need custom clash queries, such as if X and Y employee are off together. A lead and deputy in theory?
    + Want to do something similar to the query builder, but for clashes

- Block booking
    + You mentioned block booking, is there a use case where the dragging interface isn't acceptable?

- Advanced queries
    + Is this area viable?
    + What kind of questions would the project manger have? 
    + Is this flexible enough?
    + Add in datatables or some other table based query plugin?
    + Want to use heat maps for this as well, but unsure if they add value, it depends on the question

- Workstreams
    + Have not been implemented, is this necessary?

- Date ranges
    + The current date range is hardcoded, do they want some way of defining this date range? Or not necessary for demo app?
