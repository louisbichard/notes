# RAID
- Redundant array of independent disks
- A large number of separate disks in the system
- Improves reliability and performance

# Mirroring for improved reliability
+ Writing diplicate data to a separate disk drive
+ Second drive is back pu of first
+ Full duplication can be expensive
+ Could have issues with errors being on both mirrored devices
+ Floods, power surges etc can damage two equally located hard disks

# Block level striping
- Will split up the data
- Faster according to the number of drives involved
- Striped across multiple files
- Allows concurrent access of data
- Improves performance and faster according to the number of devices available
- Distributed data is an issue as if there is a problem, you lose a bit of data belonging to almost everything, therefore causing issues with all areas of the system

# Combining methods
- Reliability and performance increases of the different methods are achieved if the two methods are brought together
- RAID level 0:     Good performance, but doesn't help with reliability
- RID level 1:      Good reliability, but doesn't help with performance
- RAID levels2-5:   Something
