2a)

Taking Δ = 6
Last 6 unique values =  12, 1, 4 
Set size is 3 

Last 6 unique values = 1, 3, 7, 10
Set size = 4

2b) 

3a) 0, 1, 3
3b) No, as the data wasn't changed

4)

D <= m
(where m is the total number of frames available in the system – based on the amount of main memory)

5) Calculating 4kb in bits

1kb = 2^10

1kb * 4 = 2^10 * 4

1kb * 4 = 2^10 * 2^2

1kb * 4 = 2^12
