# What are semaphors used for? 
- Is a variable that is only altered by p and v functions after it is initialised

#Â How can deadlock occur in the problem?
- If two people next to each other want access to the resource at the same time, then deadlock will occur

# Critical versus remainder section
- The critical section occurs during the p operation
- The remainder section is that performed by the v operation

# The two operations that can be ran on a semaphor are p and v operations
p-operation: Checks whether the resource is locked, if it isn't it enters and secures the lock and runs the operation
v-operation: An operation that free's the lock when it's finished with the processing in the specified area

# What are the critical selection 
- The critical section is the area of resource that is trying to be accessed by two processes simultaneously

# What is the remainder of a process

# What is the critical section problem?
- Ensuring that no 2 processes are accessing the critical section at the same time?
