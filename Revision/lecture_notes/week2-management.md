##The three main categories of innovation

* Product
* Service
* Process

##Degrees of innovation

* Transformational
* Radical
* Incremental

##Types of innovation

* Competence enhancing innovation
* Competence destroying innovation
* Component innovation
	* An innovation to one or more components that does not significantly affect the overall configuration of the system

##Measuring innovation

###Amount spent on R&D

Advantages: 

* Data is readily available 
* Can be analysed by industrial sector
* Useful measure of performance

Limitations

* Patents are a measure of invention, not innovation
* Patents are not the only way to protect ideas
* Patents are not of equal value ( some are worthless )

Worth to managers: 

* Useful to measure the contents of patents filed by competitors
* Patent counts are used as an indication of knowledge base in mergers and aquisition

###Number of patents filed

Advantages: 

* Usually published in company reports
* Widely used


Disadvantages: 

* Input measure rather than output

Worth to managers: 

* R&D spend of competitors is a useful benchmark
	
###Number of new products

Advantages: 

* Measure of R&D output
* Can include innovations sourced externally

Disadvantages: 

* The meaning of new product is equivocal
* Seldom available externally so comparisons with others are not easy

Worth to managers: 

* Define what counts as a new product/ service 
* Few companies use this measure to check the perfomance of their competitors


##The 'S Curve'

* Organisations innovate to deliver increasing satisfaction to their stakeholders
* Important to understand what happens when new products and services are introduced
* The capability ceiling ( Foster 1986 ) // TODO: RESEARCH THIS MORE

###What it looks like

* The order of which it takes for acceptance and adoption of categories of people

Order: 

* Innovators
* Early adopters
* Early majority
* Early minority
* Laggards
