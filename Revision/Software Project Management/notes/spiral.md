# Overview
- Developed by Boehm in 1988
- Incorporating risk management into software development
- More a 'method'
- Each cycle attempts to identify alternatives, resolve risks, plan next cycle by reviewing the current one
- Each cycle doesn't necissarily end up in an improved software system
- Cycle might just be to explore some prototypes

# The four stages
__Planning__: Determine objectives
__Risk analysis:__ Evaluate alternatives and resolve risks
__Engineering__: Work is complete (or software developed)
__Analysis__: Plan next cycle

# Integration with other models
__Waterfall__: Each spiral could be the output from each stage of the process
__Evolutionary__: Each spiral release could be next evolution
__Incremental__: Each spiral release could be the next increment

# Advantages
- Accomodates requirement changes
- Incorporates risk management in the software process
- Integrates reliable project management principles with the SDLC
- Uses identical approaches for each development stage
