# Build and fix
===============

- Earliest model of software development
- Analysis, synthesis and operation overlap
- Informal
- After several fixes, the system becomes hard to maintain
- Often doesn't match user requirements
- Costly to maintain

# Stagewise model
=================

- Developed by Benington
- When a stage has been completed it becomes a fixed baseline from which following stages develop
- Is _Unidirectional_
- No revisiting of stages
- Useful for large and small projects

// TODO: Draw out the model

## Advantages 

- Encourages specification of th
- Track progress more acurately
- Demands documents are produced
- Reduces development and maintenance costs
- Enables resources to be more structured and manageable

# CLASSICAL WATERFALL MODEL
===========================
- First published model of a software development process
- Derived from other engineering processes
- Is simple in design
- Possibility of sometimes referring back up
- Requirements can be out of date before the project is complete
- Target system not available until the end
- Most use to systems with complete specifications

## Advantages of waterfall
- Some clients like the idea of 'go away and develop it'
- Like the idea of getting a quote

## Problems with the waterfall/ Stage-wise approach
- Implementation big bang at the end
- Costs of errors increase as a project moves on
