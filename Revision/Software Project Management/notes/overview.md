`A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result` - (PMI, 2011)

`Planned program of work that requires a definitive amount of time, effort and planning to complete` (Layton 2009)

# Difference between projects and operations
============================================

## Projects

__Features__: Unique, finite, unbalanced objects, transient resources

__Examples__: Building the channel tunnel, an assignment, writing an operating system

## Operations

__Features__: Repetitive, eternal, balanced objectives, stable in resources


# Difficulties in project managment
===================================

__Complexity__
__Flexibility__
__Invisibility__
__High-level loanguages__
__Software integration__
__Conformity__
__Future unknowns__
__Process is ongoing__
__Many 'solutions'__
__Expertise are lacking__


// TODO: RESEARCH ESSCENCES AND ACCIDENTS IN TERMS OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT

# Failure reasons
==================

## Why projects fail


__Bad estimates__
__Scope changes__: Scope creep
__Unrealistic expectations__
__Insufficient resources__

## Mitigating failure

__Recognised process__
__Keep it simple__
__Small teams__
__Implement change frequently__
__Manage user expectations__
__Use walkthroughs__
__Use proven technology__

# Two aspects to software development projects
===============================================

## Product oriented processes

Geared to the development and implementation of the software using the projects resources

## Project management process

Managing, controlling the project, defining work, scheduling, motivating

# The software development lifecycle
====================================

Analysis -> Synthesis -> Operation -> Retirement

Requirements -> Design -> Building -> Testing -> Implementing

# Definition: Sofware project management
========================================

`Tools, techniques, methods and proceses used to manage large software projects`

# SPM Methods
=============

// TODO: Research all of these methods

## Propriety

__LDSM__: Learmonth SDM
__Navigator__: Ernst and Young
__Method 1__: Buying, training and implementing

## Public domain

__SSADM__
__Agile__

# SPM Techniques
=================

__Requirements__: Soft systems, DFD's Rich pictures, Structure charts
__Design stage__: JSD, OOD, SSADM

# Top down and bottom up development

__Horizontal top down__: Starts from the main core and implements each level completely
__Vertical top down__: Goes from the top core down to complete whole features or sections first
__Bottom up__: Starts with the more intricate details of implementation such as the algorithm that might underpin the system
