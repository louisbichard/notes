# Overview
- is a refined interpretation of stage wise or waterfall models
- Model emphasises testing in the latter stages
- Identifies that if problems are found on the right hand side, these can be fixed with changes to the left hand side
- Based on the assumption that end users don't care about the development stages, just that the end result is correct

# Difference to waterfall 
Focus of waterfall is _activities_ whereas with V model it is _outputs and correctness_

# Left vs Right
__Left side__: Defines what happens in stages which derive the elements of the system
__Right side__: Delivery of elements to form system

# Testing in the v process modle
__Module testing__: Do all modules behave as they should
__Integration and system test__: As the system is integrated together, does it work correctly and match the design
__Acceptance testing__: Does it match requirements? does it work in the target environment?
__The real test__: Users working on the system fully
