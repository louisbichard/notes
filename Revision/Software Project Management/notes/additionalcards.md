# 5d. A basic COCOMO-model calculation of a project gives a 12 person-month estimate for effort. However, the project would make a "high" use of the available computer execution time and storage (TIME and STOR cost drivers are 1.11 and 1.04 respectively). The purchase of new computer hardware at £50,000 would reduce the execution time and storage to normal. Is this purchase worthwhile if a software engineer costs £3,000 per month to employ?

The extra 2 months effort with the old system would cost: 2*3,000 = £6,000
Conclusion: The purchase of the new hardware is not found to be cost effective.
There is a saving of £6,000 against an outlay of £50,000. It would make sense
for programme managers/directors to decide on the purchase rather than the PM
in this case.
