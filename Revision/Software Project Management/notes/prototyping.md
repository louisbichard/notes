# Throw away prototyping
- Need not be on the same hardware platform
- Could be mocked using rudimentary tools
- Might develop the prototype in a different language first
- Could just mock up the interface
- Use a test database
- Modified existing system

# Advantages
- Something tangible produced quickly
- Misunderstandings and errors sorted early
- Improves communications with the user
- Tests the feasibility of the system
- Alternatives can be compared

# Disadvantages
- Might give bad impression to the user
- Could end up developing on a poor prototype
- May not spot technical issues if not fully mocking up, or mocking up properly in the same language

# Horizontal vs Vertical prototyping
- Vertical tests some important technical features to clear up uncertainty
- Horizontal tests that all features can work but not to great depth
