#What is Agile?
================

## Differences between agile ang traditional approaches

__Traditional__: 

Has fixed requirements and resources and time are flexible
Traditional is _plan driven_

__Agile__: 

Has fixed resources and time and the features are estimated
Agile is _value driven_

## Agile versus traditional

Closely managed 		-> Self-directed teams
Take directions 		-> Take initiative
Seek individual rewards -> Focus on team contribution
Concentrate objectives	-> Concentrate on solutions
Follow rigid process 	-> Look for better ways of working
Reactive				-> Proactive


## Problems with traditional stratgies

* Based on construction industry
* Doesn't always suit the development industry
* So focused on delivery date that the end product is not what the customer wanted in the first place

## The agile manifesto

* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Individuals and interactions over process and tools
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

# Managing scope in agile (Layton 2012)

1. __Vision__: Vision statement
2. __Roadmap__: Communicate and build vision into a plan
3. __Release planning__: Determine a release goal
4. __Sprint planning__: Release goals, dev team must understand
5. __Sprint review__: Sets the tone of each sprint review meeting by reiterating the scope of the sprint
6. __Sprint retrospective__: Scrum team can discuss how well they met the scopes

## 12 Principles of agile (Carroll, 2012)

1 - Customer satisfaction
2 - Changing requirements
3 - Frequent delivery
4 - Measure of progress
5 - Sustainable development
6 - Close cooperation
7 - Motivated individuals
8 - Face to face communication
9 - Technical excellence
10 - Simplicity
11 - Self-organising teams
12 - Regular adaption

## Managing agile

"A style of project management that focuses on early delivery of business value, continuous improvement of the projectâ€™s product and processes, scope flexibility, team input and delivering well-tested products that reflect customer needs." - Layton, 2009

## Monitoring 

__Backlog__: Prioritisation: MoSCoW analysis
__Burndown__: Delivery of features as compared to original estimates

## The agile process: 

__Getting started (pre-project)__: Make sure the terms of reference are correct (definition of done)
__Feasibility__: Possible from a business and a technical stand point?
__Foundations__: Fixed timebox of planning, prioritise requirements, set out delivery plans, change control plan
__Development__: Timeboxed completion of features, milestones, testing, 
__Deployment__: Covers the implementation of an increment release, complete acceptance testing, provide training where necessary
__Post project__: Measuring the benefits of the solution that was delivered, project successes recorded

# Extreme programming
=======================
- Best in smaller projects
- Another popular agile process. 
- Delivers the software that is needed as it is needed. Emphasises team work. 
- Advocates pair programming
- Good in changing requirement environments
- Form of evolutionary delivery

## Four basic development activities
- Coding
- Testing
- Listening
- Design

## Five values
- Communication
- Simplicity
- Feedback
- Courage
- Respect

### Lean development
====================
- Based on the lean manufacturing

## Principles

- __Elminate waste__: Unnecessary code, bureaucracy, bad communications
- __Decide as late as possible__: Removes uncertainty, best option choice
- __Delivery as fast as possible__: 
- __Empower the teams__:

# DSDM (Dynamic systems delivery model)
=======================================

- First launched in 1995
- Works best on projects between 3-6 months
- Tries to resolve issues regarding projects failing because of people rather than technology
- Simple solutions fit for purpose will be easier to maintain and modify in future
- 13 different roles 
- Uses MoSCoW 
- Models, prototypes, storyboards are utilitsed
- 

# 8 Principles of DSDM
1. Understand the business need
2. Deliver on time
3. Collaborate
4. No comporomise on quality
5. Build incrementally
6. Develop iteratively
7. Communicate continuously
8. Demonstrate control

# 5 stages of DSDM
- Feasibility
- Foundations
- Exploration
- Engineering
- Deployment

# Scrum
========

- Originally formalised for software development. 
- Between 5 and 9 people in a team
- Prioritises backlog and a set amount of time to complete the tasks. 
- Meets each day to assess progress (scrum)
- Terms: 
	- __Product owner__: Vision for product, represents customer, owns the backlog, orders items in the backlog
	- __Scrum master__: Expert and advisor, coach & facilitator
	- __Team__: Creates and owns estimates
	- __Sprint__: A timeboxed development environment focused on a deliverable
	- __Standup__: Eliminate blocking issues, larger products may have a scrum of scrums

## Scrum stories

__I__: Independent
__N__: Negotiable
__V__: Valuable
__E__: Estimatable
__S__: Small
__T__: Testable

## Sprints

- Time dependent
- Timeboxed meetings (15 minutes)
- Retrospective for any changes to the process
