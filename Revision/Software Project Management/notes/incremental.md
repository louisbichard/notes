# Prioritising of increments
- Assessing module dependencies
- Organise and prioritise by value for effort
- _Value to cost_ ratios may be used

# Advantages
- Gets a release out quick for user testing
- Can incorporate feedback into next processes
- Useful working system early on is a psychological boost to the developer
- Good for management as they can see the process
- Shorter goals are easier to manage and measure status
- Earlier implementation and benefit to customer
- Good if cash flow is an issue

# Disadvantages
- Must organise development so that individual elements can be created in isolation
- May require education and training in order to understand how to subdivide the system
- Requires extensive understanding of the system from the start
