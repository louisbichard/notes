# Build and fix
===============

- Earliest model of software development
- Analysis, synthesis and operation overlap
- Informal
- After several fixes, the system becomes hard to maintain
- Often doesn't match user requirements
- Costly to maintain

# Stagewise model
=================

- Developed by Benington
- When a stage has been completed it becomes a fixed baseline from which following stages develop
- Is _Unidirectional_
- No revisiting of stages
- Useful for large and small projects

`sdfsdfs`
// TODO: Draw out the model

- Encourages specification of the system prior to building including _component interaction_
- Track progress more acurately
- Demands documents are produced
- Reduces development and maintenance costs
- Enables resources to be more structured and manageable
