# 4 step process of risk management
* Identify sources of risk
* Determine impacts 
* Determine how each risk can be reduced
* Develop and implement a plan to control and reduce risk


#Â How is the impact of risk calculated?

Impact = Likelihood x Consequence

Likelihood = 1-3
Consequence = 1-5

# What is RAG reporting? 
* Risk impacts as compared to the scale Red, Amber, Green. 

# What are the 3 ways to reduce risk
* Avoidance: Plan to eliminate the risk
* Deflection: Pass the risk on to someone else
* Contingency: Plan what to do if the deviations do occur
