#Overview
=========
- Developed in small steps
- Grows from embryonic core
- Can change direction
- Similar to prototype but is not thrown away
- Similar to build and fix but with more rigorous steps
- 

# Difference between evolutionary and incremental
- Feedback on right and wrong is essential to evolutionary 

# Difference from build and fix
- There is a planned sequence of deliverables from the start
- Can change direction
- Has initial requirements capture

# Advantages
- The customer gets an early experience of the system
- Allows requirements to be redefined
- Find and remove errors and omissions
- Early correction of errors reduces total cost
- No need for thorough initial investigation
- Useful when requirements are unclear

# Disadvantages
- Code needs to be well structured/organised (commented)
- Initial release may look limited to the user

# Configuration management
===========================
- Must control changes to the system and document them correctly
- Version control is important to be able to revert to previous releases (version numbering)

## Stages
__Configuration identification__: Identify attributes that define the system
__Change control__: Manage and approve changes to the item
__Status accounting__: Record the baselines
__Configuration audits__: Ensure changes do what they say they will do,
