# Question 1

Will we need to know many examples, such as why projects fail? NASA etc?

# Question 2

Regarding theories such as the boehm cycle, is it necessary to use your headings to describe the phases, as there are slightly different headings in the industry?

# Question 3

Do we need to know the radial adjusted boehm spiral? And all the intricate details that come with it?

# In the project management page there are lots of bits about feasibility and this stuff, do we really need to know all about this, i.e the different phases, the phases of PRINCE2 etc?

# Why are some conventional graphs drawn as steps and others drawn as straight lines

# Do we have to learn those weird cloud diagrams about projects?
