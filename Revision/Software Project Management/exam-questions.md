### In the generic software development life cycle (SDLC) why is there sometimes overlap between the stages?  (5 marks)

### How have software development models evolved over the years in an attempt to overcome the problems of requirements capture? (8 marks)

### Under what circumstances is a conventional approach to software development ( waterfall or stage-wise model ) more appropriate than contemporary sophisticated models (4 marks)

### Explain what is meant by an incremental model. How is it an improvement on the conventional waterfall model? (7 marks)

### What are the main pinciples behind an agile approach?

### What are the advantages of a technical review as a means of statically testing a software system

### Explain why focus changes between elements during project management life cycles

### Discuss the techniques that are used to quantify risks in software development projects

### Measurements are made in software development projects for three purposes: prediction, control and estimation. Explain the difference between these 3 terms in context

### Discuss the problems associated with using lines of code in an estimate of project effort

#Graphs
=======

### Draw a functionality cost benefit graph for a typical software project (ie one that provides at least some return on investment) and identify any key points on your diagram

### Redraw the functionality time graph (including both the conventional and evolutionary approach) to show how it would look if applied to a project in which the requirements were clear and fixed
