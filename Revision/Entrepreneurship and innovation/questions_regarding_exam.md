#Question 1: RE: Theory of planned behaviour

"How can the 'Theory of planned behaviour' be used to explain entrepreneurial behaviour? (20 marks)" 

Would you expect all six areas to be discussed in detail, or even highlighted at all? Can you just say that there are six areas and then go into depth on a couple?

## Question 2: Barriers to growth

	"What barriers to __firm growth__ are often encountered by the entrepreneur (10 marks)"

 Are we talking about general barriers to the business growth, or specifically originating from the entrepreneur themselves?
