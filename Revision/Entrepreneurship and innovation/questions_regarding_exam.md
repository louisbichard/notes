#Question 1: RE: Theory of planned behaviour

"How can the 'Theory of planned behaviour' be used to explain entrepreneurial behaviour? (20 marks)" 

Would you expect all six areas to be discussed in detail, or even highlighted at all? Can you just say that there are six areas and then go into depth on a couple?

## Question 2: Barriers to growth

	"What barriers to __firm growth__ are often encountered by the entrepreneur (10 marks)"

 Are we talking about general barriers to the business growth, or specifically originating from the entrepreneur themselves?

# Is there a difference between basic uses of IP and using IP to protect 'ideas' thus they need answering differently?

	With reference to the main types of __intellectual property__ describe how inventors can protect their ideas. In each case briefly explain the process for securing intellectual property rights on an idea (20 marks)

# Is the innovative process just the smaller, or larger description?

	Idea creation -> Selection -> Implementaiton

or 

	Idea Formation -> Opportunity Recognition -> Planning and preparation -> Entrepreneurship entry -> Launch

^ This was identified in the course reading book

# Does franchising count as a method of earning finance from intellectual property?


# For the essay questions, you talk about analysis of the business currently and recommendations, can these be merged together, i.e assess one section like strategy and then go on to recommend, then assess finance? For instance?
