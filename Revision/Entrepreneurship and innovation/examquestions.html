<p>The innovative process is defined as:</p>
<pre><code>Create ideas -&gt; Select best idea -&gt; Implement
</code></pre>
<p>However in some cases is extended as</p>
<pre><code>Recognition -&gt; Invention -&gt; Development -&gt; Implementation -&gt; Diffusion
</code></pre>
<p>In the selection phase:</p>
<p><em>Subject area knowledge</em>: Closely linked to time, an entrepreneur must spend the time learning the market for which they want to enter and assessing the risks and balancing and addressing issues that exist across their varying products.</p>
<p>Most of the barriers that the entrepreneur will encounter will be within the implementation phase as this is when an entrepreneur must make the most risk, financially and personally. </p>
<p><em>Financials</em> are a barrier to implementation of a small firm. As a seed company, an entrepreneur will need to look for investments from friends and family and invest their own capital as the idea hasn&rsquo;t yet been taken to market and therefore will struggle for formal investment in the forms of venture capital, or bank finance. </p>
<p><em>Time</em>: Most of these ideas will be born by employees in an industry who notice an opportunity and want to turn it into a business, they will however struggle to find the amount of time necessary to invest into a business to research the idea and bring it to market. </p>
<p><em>The external environment</em>: The market conditions must support then entrepreneurs business, the competition must be scalable, or the niche must be differentiated enough to gain market share. </p>

(20)</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Measuring numbers of small businesses reflects the amount of replicative innovators that are in the economy - as defined by Schumpter. Egypt often comes out more entrepreneurial than America (Henrekson) when using this statistic. Henrekson also argued that self-made billionaires produces a much better measurement of entrepreneurial vigor in an economy. Small businesses are a sign of stagnation in the economy as no other jobs are available, successful businesses tend to destroy the smaller companies as they take up the market: I.e Walmart or Amazon. However this has implications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Entrepreneurs tend to be highly educated, 45% of american self-made entrepreneurs have advanced degrees. This is different to how it was at the start of the 1900&rsquo;s with engineers like Henry Ford dropping out of school. The service economy is king. </p>

<p>The S curve is plotted in terms of adoption rate in the market (y axis) and time (x axis) and forms an S shape due to the slow adoption, followed by exponential growth, stagnation and eventually decline. </p>

(20 marks)</h4>
<p>The theory of planned behaviour is a psychological tool that is used to predict the <em>likelihood that a person will partake in a specific act or behaviour</em>. The theory of planned behaviour is broken down into 6 main constructs that all determine someones behaviour. It should also be highlighted that a lot of the areas are to do with the entrepreneurs <em>perception</em> of the situation, not just the actual situation itself. The theory however does not plan in different elements of behaviour intention such as mood, fear or past antecedent experience. </p>
<p><em>Attitude</em> can affect an entrepreneurs behaviour, where the entrepreneur has a favourable evaluation of their behaviour of interest for instance, is the project a worthy cause? Will the entrepreneur earn enough money to live? Is it ethical (if the entrepreneur is likely to consider ethics).</p>
<p><em>Subjective Norms</em> refer to the perceptions of those around the entrepreneur. It is likely that if an entrepeneur speaks to their parents, they will want to entrepreneur to be safe and stable and not take risks, however if the entrepreneur is in social groups where entrepreneurial risky behaviour is normal, they are likely to conduct these behaviours. </p>
<p><em>Social norms</em> refers to the customary codes of behaviour within the society within which the entrepreneur resides. Different countries have different likelhihoods of entrepreneurial behaviour and this is related to the social norm of those societies. In some socities where it is customary for a woman to stay at home and do house work are less likely to participate in entrepreneurial behaviour. </p>
<p><em>Behavioural control</em> refers to the perception that the entrepreneur has over the situation. Are they smart enough, do they have the right resources etc. </p>

<p>// INCLUDE SOME QUOTE FROM GROWTH NOTES ABOUT FIRM GROWTH</p>
<p>When assessing firms growth this can be done well through use of a PESTEL analysis to address the business positioning. </p>
<p><em>Political</em>: implications to growth could include goverment support, and therefore access to grants and financing. </p>
<p><em>Environmental</em>: A large consideration and could mean the competitors already in the market and their organisational structure. It may be that the market will not facilitate new competitors as it is already saturated, and larger companies will resist attempts to grow through cut price strategies, leveraging their own <em>economies of scale</em>. Furthermore as argued by Bridge et al (2003) growth cannot occur without innovation and the company will most likely need innovative new products in order to gain growth and market share. Similar to the <em>storey</em> frameowork of growth, the organisations strategy is important to growth. The organisation must have direction and a vision for the markets they are targeting. </p>
<p><em>Social</em> factors, again similar to <code>the entrepreneur</code> factor in <em>storey&rsquo;s</em> (1994) theory of staged growth the entrepreneur must possess the right skills to create growth in the organisation. Skills such as the attitude to want to grow as Bridge et al (2003) identifies, some entrepreneurs do not want to grow their firm anymore as percieved benefits do not outweight the costs and thus the entrepreneur is in (as Bridge refers to it &lsquo;the comfort zone&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>Economical</em>: Lastly economical factors such as the cash flow available to the organisation or their access to capital and financing will influence growth. </p>

(15 marks) (3 occurences)</h4>
<p>Schumpeter has 2 views of entrepreneurs: Those who are replicators of existing ideas and those who are innovators, for this question I will focus on the innovators. Schumpter percieved entrepreneurs to have a special set of characteristics that allowed them to be creative in coming up with new solutions, pushing boundaries and crashing into new markets and disrupting the zeitgeist. Schumpter exemplified these creative attributes in his theory of <em>creative destruction</em> which highlights ways that an entrepreneur will disrupt a market with their creativity in the form of new <em>products</em>, <em>markets</em>, <em>organisation</em> types etc.  However on the otherhand this differs to Kirzners view. Kirzner believed that entrepreneurs were not special people and anyone could be an entrepreneur aslong as they spot opportunities in a market and work to exploit these. Kirzners view on entrepreneurs is a lot less elaborate than Schumpeters. </p>
<h4 id="opportunity-spotting-and-idea-creation-is-an-essential-part-of-the-innovation-process-how-do-entrepreurs-identify-new-product-and-or-service-opportunities-25-marks"><strong>Opportunity spotting</strong> and idea creation is an essential part of the <strong>innovation process</strong>. How do entrepreurs identify new product and or service opportunities (25 marks)</h4>
<p>The innovative process is: </p>
<pre><code>Creating ideas -&gt; Assessing and choosing the best ideas -&gt; Implementation of the idea
</code></pre>
<p>Entrepreneurs may find opportunities in 3 main areas, gaps in the market, technological innovations or by looking into the future. </p>
<p>Market opportunities can be identified a number of different ways, the first and most obvious being by having a <em>keen entrepreneurial eye</em> within the indutstry. Secondly, using <em>market intelligence</em> tools can also <em>detect changes in customer demands</em> by measuring and analysing figures regarding the size, shape and dynamics of the market. Entrepreneurs can also use the <em>schumpeter replicator theory</em> of the entrepreneur to copy existing organisations in the instance of <em>southwest airlines</em> being copied by Stelios, but given a USP such as reduced travel agents to provide a low cost airline that met market demands. </p>
<p>Secondly, opportunities can be found in <em>technological innovations</em>. This can sometimes be known as <em>&lsquo;blue skies research&rsquo;</em> which refers to the act of researching technologies that aren&rsquo;t immediately apparent. This however can be very risky and expensive for an entrepreneur. </p>
<p>Lastly, opportunities can be found in the future space. Predicting future changes is based on trends or <em>PESTLE analysis</em> that analyses political, environmental, social, technological and economic changes in the businesses domain. Working closely with univeristies conducting blue skies research can help organistaions to generate new innovative products to bring to market.</p>

Evaluate the Storey Framework as a way of identifiying firms that are likely to achieve a high level of growth (20 marks) (2 occurences)</h4>
<p>The storey framework <em>consists of measuring 3 characteristics</em> to predict growth: <em>The entrepreneur</em>, <em>the strategy</em> they employ and <em>the company itself</em>. It is argued that these <em>factors are not independent</em> and must all be present at the correct level in order for a business to be deemed in a position to achieve large rates of growth. </p>
<p>The first characteristic is that of the entrepreneur themselves which encompasses factors regarding the entrepreneur themselves and whether they are deemed to possess the relevant characteristics and skills in order to drive growth. Some examples of these characteristics are <em>motivation</em>, <em>education</em>, <em>Management experiencee</em>. </p>
<p>Secondly is the factors of <em>the company</em> itself. The company encompasses usually decisions by the entrepreneur when they set up the organisation and remain fairly constant once they start trading. This is measured by addressing factors such as the <em>companies age</em>, <em>culture</em> and <em>structure</em>. </p>
<p>Lastly is <em>the strategy</em> of the organistation itself which is arguably the most important and interesting characteristic. Includes factors such as the market position of the company, training of the workforce, any new products it has in the pipeline and competitors. </p>

<p>Intellectual property is non-physical property that is the product of original thought. Intellectual property allow artists and creators to gain rights to prosecute those infringing their rights by copying their ideas. </p>
<p><em>Patents</em> are a type of intellectual property that protects inventions with regards to what they do and how they achieve it, including what they are made of etc. Applicatin for a patent must be done through the patent office for the region that it is to be registered. The process involves filing the patent for review (known as <em>patent pending</em>) and the office must decide whether to abandon or grant the patent. The idea must be original and not currently known to the public, known as <em>prior art</em> (pre-existing knowledge of the idea in the public domain). The patent will then last 20 years and can be licensed or sold. </p>
<p><em>Design rights</em> are protection over the look or appearance of a certain object, or part of an object applying to 2D objects, colours, shapes, contours etc. Design rights must be registered and paid for and then last for 20 years. </p>

<p><em>Banks</em> will invest in businesses, however will be reluctant to do so in the case of small businesses. Banks can provide large sources of funding, but there will be little feedback and assistance. Banks are primarily bothered about <em>ROI</em> and finances. </p>
<p><em>Venture capitalists</em> will invest in small companies (however not seeds) and are more open to taking risk if the reward can be seen. Venture capitalists are often likely to invest in indivduals as they will need to work with them, and often they are investing in the businesses ability to generate ideas, rather than on one sole investment. </p>
<p><em>Grants</em> are usually government funding &lsquo;pots&rsquo; of money available to certain business types. Grants are advantageous in that you do not have to &lsquo;pay them back&rsquo; however the application <em>proccesses can be lengthy and competitive</em>. </p>
<p><em>Crowd sourcing</em> is a form of funding that comes from a large group of people all investing a small amount of income to reach a larger total. Crowd sourcing works best for <em>customer facing</em> &lsquo;simple products&rsquo; that solve a simple problem. Crowd sourcing is <em>not good for larger companies</em> with technical and complex solutions or ones that aren&rsquo;t in the basic customer domain I.E business to business. Crowd sourcing is very good for seed businesses as the small investment means a the risk is offset to investors. </p>

<p>A Venture capitalist is usually an individual investor that looks to take equity in a company in return for a stake of the business returns. Venture capatilists are open to large risks in order to achieve higher returns and will work closely with the organisation in order to achieve this. </p>
<p><em>Relationship to owners</em> is important as the VC will work closely with the business and the venture capatilist has to be sure that the owners are the correct type of people to compliment their personality type. </p>
<p><em>Evidence of bootstrapping</em> is important, the organisation must prove that it has some market need and that it is now gaining traction. Venture capitalists will tend not to invest in seedling companies as they are too risky. </p>
<p><em>ROI</em> is another big factor for VC&rsquo;s. Since they are investing in mostly small companies with large sums of money, the VC must have potential reward to offset the risk. The risk is particularly high as small companies often do not have much to offset the investment. </p>
<p><em>Exit strategy</em> is another big factor for VC&rsquo;s. It is the way that a VC will &lsquo;cash out&rsquo; on its investment. A VC hopes to sell its equity in the company in 3-7 years, ideally in the IPO of the company.</p>

<p>Some steps that the government are taking to tackle issues identified in the report are:</p>
<p><em>Skills</em>: The government will look to invest more in skills that support innovative behaviour, inclusive of higher education. <br />
<em>Skills</em>: Ensure the economy has the correct skills to support innovative behaviour<br />
<em>Supporting innovation</em>: Advisory services, development of flexible leadership and management programmes<br />
<em>Supporting women entrepreneurs</em>: Improve business advice, mentoring and networking<br />
<em>Changing national measurements</em>: NMS (National measurement system) will be improved so that it reflects innovation more greatly.</p>

<p>Innovative culture is generally most effective in small businesses if the <em>market conditions</em> permit such behaviour and can be argued to exist mostly in niche markets. The markets that are best are usually where the market values product variety and producer flexibility  <em>(Deakins and Freel, 2003)</em>. </p>
<p>Locating in a <em>&lsquo;porterian cluster&rsquo;</em> can help to increase a firms ability to be innovative. By being around other related firms in a geographic cluster can help to foster and develop new innovative ideas <em>(Porter, 1990)</em>.</p>
