###First+ 

Excellent demonstration of appropriate analysis that is well applied to the question with clear evidence of reading and good evaluation.  As good an answer as one can expect by an undergraduate at this stage of their degree programme.

###First 

Excellent answer with clear attempt at evaluation plus evidence of good understanding of the underlying analysis and reading.

###2.1

Good answer that is applied to the question set and that shows evidence of reading and understanding backed by appropriate analysis.  There may be some minor misconceptions and the candidate may demonstrate underdeveloped or limited evaluation.  

13BSC522 Exam feedback
Question 1
You were required to write a report for Charnwood Theatre Company Limited that included a critical evaluation of their current business activities and suggested ways in which they could improve future business performance.
Feedback
Generally this question was answered well.  Critical analysis required you to look at the internal, external micro and external macro environment within which the company operated.  For internal analysis, you could evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the company and the individuals working there.  You should consider things such as:
Skills of the founders and employees
Finance
Intellectual property (e.g. brand protection etc.)
Operations – including location and structure
For external micro analysis, you should have considered opportunities and threats.  You should have considered who the company’s customers are and how they are currently positioning and selling and marketing its services/products.
External threats will include competitors (direct and indirect).
For macro external analysis you could have used a PESTLE analysis.  There were some clues in the case study such as a Government cuts in funding for the arts.  This would probably have an indirect negative affect on the business.
The second part of the question required you to address these issues and come up with solutions.  Many students attempted to do this and generally answers were good.  Marks were gained for doing an enhanced SWOT and including academic theory such as Porter, Ansoff, growth models etc.
Very good answers included real life examples to show that the recommendations made had been used by other companies.  For example, some of you mentioned:
where an existing company had changed location to be closer to their customers 
where a company had started to sell on-line
where a company had sought funding from a business angel in order to bring in business expertise.


Question 2
Generally this question was answered well.  Marks were lost by not including
examples and a few people reproduced the table from the lectures with little
explanation.

Question 2a required a definition of innovation.  You should have then described the three economic measures of innovation
No of patents 
Advantages – data is readily available and can be analysed by industry sector.   
Disadvantages – patents are a measure of invention not innovation and ideas can be protected by other forms of intellectual property (design rights etc.).  Patents are not of equal value – some can be worthless.

R&D expenditure
Advantages - Usually published in company reports
Disadvantage – input measure, rather than an output measure

No of new products/services
Advantage – measure of R&D activity
Disadvantage – could be an innovation sourced externally, sometimes difficult to define what counts as a new product/service
Very good answers included examples of companies who produce lots of patents and products / spend money on R&D.

Question 2b required you to explain an S-curve in terms of the introduction or sales of a new product or service.  Some students produced graphs but many of these were not labelled in a clear way.  Others gave a graph but a limited explanation.  
Question 3
Question 3 required you to describe patents, design rights and trademarks.  Copyright and trade secrets were not required.  Many students gave a good description of the main types of registered IP but some forgot to illustrate their answers with real examples.  Very good answers talked about prior art (patenting) for example.  Other very good answers discussed why companies register their ideas to gain a commercial advantage.
Answers should have briefly described what can be protected by each type of IP and the process a person must go through to protect their IP (e.g. formal registration with the IP Office).  Costs of registering and maintaining IP should have be referenced and better answers described why one method of protection may be better than another (could depend on whether the idea needs global or home protection).

Question 4
There were some very good answers to this question. Poorer answers didn’t back up theories with real life examples.  
You should have started your answer by explaining that entrepreneurship is difficult to define because academics cannot agree.  There are three schools of thought (economic, psychological and sociological) and students should have given a critical analysis of each, demonstrating differences and overlaps where appropriate. 
The economists – you should have referred to Schumpeter, Kirzner and Knight and shown how they have described entrepreneurship in terms of creative destruction, opportunity spotting (middle man/woman) and risk taking.
The psychologists – you should have described how psychologists have moved away from looking at the personality of an entrepreneur to investigating the cognitive behaviour of these individuals.  Good answers gave examples of academics who have investigated different psychological traits of entrepreneurs such as attitude, motivation, locus of control, self-efficacy. Very good answers linked these traits back to the economists’ views.
The sociologists – you should have described how sociologists have made it a question of how environment affects entrepreneurship.  Sociologists view entrepreneurship as a set of practices, intimately related to the context or environment.  They asked ‘how’ does entrepreneurship happens.  Using academic examples, good answers demonstrated that for sociologists, the entrepreneur is a ‘practitioner’, seeking to navigate the environment.

Question 5

This was a very popular question and generally students showed a good understanding of the different methods of funding available to entrepreneurs.  Advantages and disadvantages were required and very good answers were illustrated with real examples of funders and funding schemes e.g. who are the banks, business angels, and VCs / what grants are available etc.

Section b of this question required you to describe how they would evaluate the success of a new government funding scheme to encourage innovation in a small business.  Most of you produced relevant answers referring to measures of successful innovation such as production of IP, an increase in new products and services, an increase in R&D.  There are more measures such as, an increase in number of employees, a re-location to a new premises and a change in company status (e.g. sole-trader to limited company).
