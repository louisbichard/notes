##Section 2 questions (back to 2008)

###General innovation

####What do you understand to be the 'S curve' in relation to the introduction of a new product or service? (5 marks) (2 occurrences)

The 'S-curve' in relation to the release of a new product is the time taken for adoption from different categories of people and closely resembles and reflects the product lifecycle. 

The S curve is plotted in terms of adoption rate in the market (y axis) and time (x axis) and forms an S shape due to the slow adoption, followed by exponential growth, stagnation and eventually decline. 

In order of adoption, the 5 groups are: 

* Innovators
* Early adopters
* Early majority
* Early minority
* Laggards

###Opportunities

####Opportunity spotting and idea creation is an essential part of the innovation process. How do entrepreurs identify new product and or service opportunities (25 marks)

Entrepreneurs may find opportunities in 3 main areas, gaps in the market, technological innovations or by looking into the future. 

Market opportunities can be identified a number of different ways, the first and most obvious being by having a __keen entrepreneurial eye__ within the indutstry. Secondly, using __market intelligence__ tools can also __detect changes in customer demands__ by measuring and analysing figures regarding the size, shape and dynamics of the market. Entrepreneurs can also use the __schumpeter replicator theory__ of the entrepreneur to copy existing organisations in the instance of __southwest airlines__ being copied by Stelios, but given a USP such as reduced travel agents to provide a low cost airline that met market demands. 

Secondly, opportunities can be found in __technological innovations__. This can sometimes be known as __'blue skies research'__ which refers to the act of researching technologies that aren't immediately apparent. This however can be very risky and expensive for an entrepreneur. 

Lastly, opportunities can be found in the future space. Predicting future changes is based on trends or __PESTLE analysis__ that analyses political, environmental, social, technological and economic changes in the businesses domain.

// TODO: ADD SOMETHING ABOUT CLOSE TIES WITH UNIVERISTIES IS GOOD FOR BLUE SKIES RESEARCH, BUT THEY NEED TO FIND THESE TIES WITH UNIVERSITIES AND THESE ARE TYPICALLY HARD TO FIND

###People - Entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship

####How can the 'Theory of planned behaviour' be used to explain entrepreneurial behaviour? (20 marks)

The theory of planned behaviour is a psychological tool that is used to predict the __likelihood that a person will partake in a specific act or behaviour__. The theory of planned behaviour is broken down into 6 main constructs that all determine someones behaviour. It should also be highlighted that a lot of the areas are to do with the entrepreneurs __perception__ of the situation, not just the actual situation itself. The theory however does not plan in different elements of behaviour intention such as mood, fear or past antecedent experience. 

__Attitude__ can affect an entrepreneurs behaviour, where the entrepreneur has a favourable evaluation of their behaviour of interest for instance, is the project a worthy cause? Will the entrepreneur earn enough money to live? Is it ethical (if the entrepreneur is likely to consider ethics).

__Subjective Norms__ refer to the perceptions of those around the entrepreneur. It is likely that if an entrepeneur speaks to their parents, they will want to entrepreneur to be safe and stable and not take risks, however if the entrepreneur is in social groups where entrepreneurial risky behaviour is normal, they are likely to conduct these behaviours. 

__Social norms__ refers to the customary codes of behaviour within the society within which the entrepreneur resides. Different countries have different likelhihoods of entrepreneurial behaviour and this is related to the social norm of those societies. In some socities where it is customary for a woman to stay at home and do house work are less likely to participate in entrepreneurial behaviour. 

__Behavioural control__ refers to the perception that the entrepreneur has over the situation. Are they smart enough, do they have the right resources etc. 

####Discuss why use of cognitive theory rather than describing personality traits may give us a better understanding of why people engage in entrepreneurial behaviour? (10 marks) (3 occurences)

####How does the schumpeterian view of the entrepreneur differ with that of kirzner? (15 marks) (3 occurences)

Schumpeter was an economist, who thought that entrepreneurs were someone special who was innately creative. Yet this creativity would only flourish in an economically stable environment. 

Schumpeter defined two types of entrepreneur: Those who were replicators of existing ideas and tended to setup small businesses and those who were innovators who would crash into a market, and disrupt the common zeitgeist to push new boundaries and develop and push new ideas. 

Kirzner on the other hand believed that entrepreneurs were opportunitists, taking advantage of holes in the market, as opposed to being innately innovative or creative, kirzner believed that entrepreneurs were more business minded than creative and had the insight and knowledge to notice these market needs and implement them.

####Giving examples, describe how acedemic economists, psychologists and sociologists have tried to define the entrepreneur? (25)

###Intellectual property

####With reference to the main types of intellectual property describe how inventors can protect their ideas. In each case briefly explain the process for securing intellectual property rights on an idea (20 marks)

Intellectual property is non-physical property that is the product of original thought. Intellectual property allow artists and creators to gain rights to prosecute those infringing their rights by copying their ideas. 

__Patents__ are a type of intellectual property that protects inventions with regards to what they do and how they achieve it, including what they are made of etc. Applicatin for a patent must be done through the patent office for the region that it is to be registered. The process involves filing the patent for review (known as __patent pending__) and the office must decide whether to abandon or grant the patent. The idea must be original and not currently known to the public, known as __prior art__ (pre-existing knowledge of the idea in the public domain). The patent will then last 20 years and can be licensed or sold. 

__Design rights__ are protection over the look or appearance of a certain object, or part of an object applying to 2D objects, colours, shapes, contours etc. Design rights must be registered and paid for and then last for 20 years.

###Measuring innovation

####Briefly describe how you would evaluate the success of a new government funding scheme available to encourage innovation in small businesses (5 marks) (5 occurences)

####Discuss why the UK's innovative performance appears to be, at best, average compare to its major competitors (DTI innovation report 2003). Incude in your answer what measure the government has taken to address this problem. (25 marks)

####With reference to their advantages and disadvantages, describe economic measures of innovation? (20)

* Measuring numbers of small businesses reflects the amount of replicative innovators that are in the economy - as defined by Schumpter. Egypt often comes out more entrepreneurial than America (Henrekson) when using this statistic. Henrekson also argued that self-made billionaires produces a much better measurement of entrepreneurial vigor in an economy. Small businesses are a sign of stagnation in the economy as no other jobs are available, successful businesses tend to destroy the smaller companies as they take up the market: I.e Walmart or Amazon. However this has implications.

* Entrepreneurs tend to be highly educated, 45% of american self-made entrepreneurs have advanced degrees. This is different to how it was at the start of the 1900's with engineers like Henry Ford dropping out of school. The service economy is king.
