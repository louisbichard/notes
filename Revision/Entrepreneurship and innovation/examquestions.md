####What do you understand to be the _'S curve'_ in relation to the introduction of a new product or service? (5 marks) (2 occurrences)

The 'S-curve' in relation to the release of a new product is the time taken for adoption from different categories of people and closely resembles and reflects the product lifecycle. 

The S curve is plotted in terms of adoption rate in the market (y axis) and time (x axis) and forms an S shape due to the slow adoption, followed by exponential growth, stagnation and eventually decline. 

In order of adoption, the 5 groups are: 

* Innovators
* Early adopters
* Early majority
* Late majority
* Laggards


####What do you understand to be the finance gap? (5 marks)

Exists because _demand_ from small firms is greater than the willingness of financial institutions to supply finance at current market conditions (_rates of interest_).

####Describe what a firm might do with its __intellectual property__ in order to maximise its value as a company asset (5 marks) (4 occurences)

__Licensing__: Intellectual property can be licensed to someone else, giving them the right to use your idea. Licenses can be granted for certain areas or particular groups of customers.

__Franchising__: Another business can setup up under your name, allowing your ideas and branding to be used by another. 

__Sale of patents__: Selling a patent is a final way of earning revenue from intellectual property. This is usually done when patents are taken out purely for the reason of selling them on later when they become of greater value. 

####__Opportunity spotting__ and idea creation is an essential part of the __innovation process__. How do entrepreurs identify new product and or service opportunities (25 marks)

The innovative process is: 

    Creating ideas -> Assessing and choosing the best ideas -> Implementation of the idea

Entrepreneurs may find opportunities in 3 main areas, gaps in the market, technological innovations or by looking into the future. 

Market opportunities can be identified a number of different ways, the first and most obvious being by having a _keen entrepreneurial eye_ within the indutstry. Secondly, using _market intelligence_ tools can also _detect changes in customer demands_ by measuring and analysing figures regarding the size, shape and dynamics of the market. Entrepreneurs can also use the _schumpeter replicator theory_ of the entrepreneur to copy existing organisations in the instance of _southwest airlines_ being copied by Stelios, but given a USP such as reduced travel agents to provide a low cost airline that met market demands. 

Secondly, opportunities can be found in _technological innovations_. This can sometimes be known as _'blue skies research'_ which refers to the act of researching technologies that aren't immediately apparent. This however can be very risky and expensive for an entrepreneur. 

Lastly, opportunities can be found in the future space. Predicting future changes is based on trends or _PESTLE analysis_ that analyses political, environmental, social, technological and economic changes in the businesses domain. Working closely with univeristies conducting blue skies research can help organistaions to generate new innovative products to bring to market.

####With reference to the __key stages__ involved in the __innovative process__ and barriers you are likely to encounter?

The innovative process is defined as:

    Create ideas -> Select best idea -> Implement

However in some cases is extended as

    Recognition -> Invention -> Development -> Implementation -> Diffusion

In the selection phase:

_Subject area knowledge_: Closely linked to time, an entrepreneur must spend the time learning the market for which they want to enter and assessing the risks and balancing and addressing issues that exist across their varying products.

Most of the barriers that the entrepreneur will encounter will be within the implementation phase as this is when an entrepreneur must make the most risk, financially and personally. 

_Financials_ are a barrier to implementation of a small firm. As a seed company, an entrepreneur will need to look for investments from friends and family and invest their own capital as the idea hasn't yet been taken to market and therefore will struggle for formal investment in the forms of venture capital, or bank finance. 

_Time_: Most of these ideas will be born by employees in an industry who notice an opportunity and want to turn it into a business, they will however struggle to find the amount of time necessary to invest into a business to research the idea and bring it to market. 

_The external environment_: The market conditions must support then entrepreneurs business, the competition must be scalable, or the niche must be differentiated enough to gain market share. 

####What barriers to __firm growth__ are often encountered by the entrepreneur (10 marks)

When assessing firms growth this can be done well through use of a PESTEL analysis to address the business positioning. 

_Political_: implications to growth could include goverment support, and therefore access to grants and financing. 

_Environmental_: A large consideration and could mean the competitors already in the market and their organisational structure. It may be that the market will not facilitate new competitors as it is already saturated, and larger companies will resist attempts to grow through cut price strategies, leveraging their own _economies of scale_. Furthermore as argued by Bridge et al (2003) growth cannot occur without innovation and the company will most likely need innovative new products in order to gain growth and market share. Similar to the _storey_ frameowork of growth, the organisations strategy is important to growth. The organisation must have direction and a vision for the markets they are targeting. 

_Social_ factors, again similar to `the entrepreneur` factor in _storey's_ (1994) theory of staged growth the entrepreneur must possess the right skills to create growth in the organisation. Skills such as the attitude to want to grow as Bridge et al (2003) identifies, some entrepreneurs do not want to grow their firm anymore as percieved benefits do not outweight the costs and thus the entrepreneur is in (as Bridge refers to it 'the comfort zone'.

_Economical_: Lastly economical factors such as the cash flow available to the organisation or their access to capital and financing will influence growth. 











SATISFIED WITH
=====================

####With reference to their advantages and disadvantages, describe __economic measures of innovation__? (20)

* Measuring numbers of small businesses reflects the amount of replicative innovators that are in the economy - as defined by Schumpter. Egypt often comes out more entrepreneurial than America (Henrekson) when using this statistic. Henrekson also argued that self-made billionaires produces a much better measurement of entrepreneurial vigor in an economy. Small businesses are a sign of stagnation in the economy as no other jobs are available, successful businesses tend to destroy the smaller companies as they take up the market: I.e Walmart or Amazon. However this has implications.

* Entrepreneurs tend to be highly educated, 45% of american self-made entrepreneurs have advanced degrees. This is different to how it was at the start of the 1900's with engineers like Henry Ford dropping out of school. The service economy is king. 





####How does the __schumpeterian__ view of the entrepreneur differ with that of kirzner? (15 marks) (3 occurences)

Schumpeter has 2 views of entrepreneurs: Those who are replicators of existing ideas and those who are innovators, for this question I will focus on the innovators. Schumpter percieved entrepreneurs to have a special set of characteristics that allowed them to be creative in coming up with new solutions, pushing boundaries and crashing into new markets and disrupting the zeitgeist. Schumpter exemplified these creative attributes in his theory of _creative destruction_ which highlights ways that an entrepreneur will disrupt a market with their creativity in the form of new _products_, _markets_, _organisation_ types etc.  However on the otherhand this differs to Kirzners view. Kirzner believed that entrepreneurs were not special people and anyone could be an entrepreneur aslong as they spot opportunities in a market and work to exploit these. Kirzners view on entrepreneurs is a lot less elaborate than Schumpeters. 

####Giving examples, describe how acedemic economists, psychologists and sociologists have tried to __define the entrepreneur__? (25)

Different appraoches exist to describing the entrepreneur.

According to __economic theory__ the entrepreneur can be viewed as someone who coordinates different factors of production. The entrepreneur is recognised as a risk taker. Economists that have formualted theories on the entrepreneur include kerzner and schumpeter. _Kirzner_ describes an entrepreneur as one who is alert. By being alert an entrepreneur can notice market gaps and work to exploit these demands as a middle man. The kirzner approach is based on a lack of supply in an industry and an exploitation of _perfect knowledge_

_Psychologists_ have offered a characteristic based approach to entrepreneurial recognition. Mclleland for instance outlined three competencies of an entrepreneur which are achievement, orientation and commitment. Other psychologists have suggested other theories such as _Friedman and roseman's_ theory of Type A and Type B as reason for entrepreneurial behaviour. Where type A's are restless, competitive and self-critical individual.This characteristic based approach however is not viewed as comprehensive as it is difficult to measure indidvidual traits.

_Sociologists_ take the viewpoint that a characteristics based approach is inadequate and that other factors may affect an individuals propensity to partake in entrepreneurial behaviours. The areas that sociologists look at include the regions that the entrepreneur resides, for instance the south east of the UK is more likely to produce entrepreneurs than the midlands. Location can play a large role on entrepreneurial behaviour as the culture of that area. When clustered near those with similar intentions this increases success (Porter, 1990). Other areas assessed by sociologists include the ability to learn, the ability to deal with failure and gender. 





















PARTIALLY COMPLETE
==================

####How can the __'Theory of planned behaviour'__ be used to explain entrepreneurial behaviour? (20 marks)

The theory of planned behaviour is a psychological tool that is used to predict the _likelihood that a person will partake in a specific act or behaviour_. The theory of planned behaviour is broken down into 6 main constructs that all determine someones behaviour. It should also be highlighted that a lot of the areas are to do with the entrepreneurs _perception_ of the situation, not just the actual situation itself. The theory however does not plan in different elements of behaviour intention such as mood, fear or past antecedent experience. 

_Attitude_ can affect an entrepreneurs behaviour, where the entrepreneur has a favourable evaluation of their behaviour of interest for instance, is the project a worthy cause? Will the entrepreneur earn enough money to live? Is it ethical (if the entrepreneur is likely to consider ethics).

_Subjective Norms_ refer to the perceptions of those around the entrepreneur. It is likely that if an entrepeneur speaks to their parents, they will want to entrepreneur to be safe and stable and not take risks, however if the entrepreneur is in social groups where entrepreneurial risky behaviour is normal, they are likely to conduct these behaviours. 

_Social norms_ refers to the customary codes of behaviour within the society within which the entrepreneur resides. Different countries have different likelhihoods of entrepreneurial behaviour and this is related to the social norm of those societies. In some socities where it is customary for a woman to stay at home and do house work are less likely to participate in entrepreneurial behaviour. 

_Behavioural control_ refers to the perception that the entrepreneur has over the situation. Are they smart enough, do they have the right resources etc. 

####Growth of a business is highly complex and depends on the interaction of different factors. Evaluate the Storey Framework as a way of identifiying firms that are likely to achieve a high level of growth (20 marks) (2 occurences)

The storey framework _consists of measuring 3 characteristics_ to predict growth: _The entrepreneur_, _the strategy_ they employ and _the company itself_. It is argued that these _factors are not independent_ and must all be present at the correct level in order for a business to be deemed in a position to achieve large rates of growth. 

The first characteristic is that of the entrepreneur themselves which encompasses factors regarding the entrepreneur themselves and whether they are deemed to possess the relevant characteristics and skills in order to drive growth. Some examples of these characteristics are _motivation_, _education_, _Management experiencee_. 

Secondly is the factors of _the company_ itself. The company encompasses usually decisions by the entrepreneur when they set up the organisation and remain fairly constant once they start trading. This is measured by addressing factors such as the _companies age_, _culture_ and _structure_. 

Lastly is _the strategy_ of the organistation itself which is arguably the most important and interesting characteristic. Includes factors such as the market position of the company, training of the workforce, any new products it has in the pipeline and competitors.

####With reference to the main types of __intellectual property__ describe how inventors can protect their ideas. In each case briefly explain the process for securing intellectual property rights on an idea (20 marks)

Intellectual property is non-physical property that is the product of original thought. Intellectual property allow artists and creators to gain rights to prosecute those infringing their rights by copying their ideas. 

_Patents_ are a type of intellectual property that protects inventions with regards to what they do and how they achieve it, including what they are made of etc. Applicatin for a patent must be done through the patent office for the region that it is to be registered. The process involves filing the patent for review (known as _patent pending_) and the office must decide whether to abandon or grant the patent. The idea must be original and not currently known to the public, known as _prior art_ (pre-existing knowledge of the idea in the public domain). The patent will then last 20 years and can be licensed or sold. 

_Design rights_ are protection over the look or appearance of a certain object, or part of an object applying to 2D objects, colours, shapes, contours etc. Design rights must be registered and paid for and then last for 20 years.

####Describe the main sources of __debt and equity finance__ for entrepreneurs and reflect on the advantages of __funding a business__ through different routes (15 marks) (2 occurences)

_Banks_ will invest in businesses, however will be reluctant to do so in the case of small businesses. Banks can provide large sources of funding, but there will be little feedback and assistance. Banks are primarily bothered about _ROI_ and finances. 

_Venture capitalists_ will invest in small companies (however not seeds) and are more open to taking risk if the reward can be seen. Venture capitalists are often likely to invest in indivduals as they will need to work with them, and often they are investing in the businesses ability to generate ideas, rather than on one sole investment. 

_Grants_ are usually government funding 'pots' of money available to certain business types. Grants are advantageous in that you do not have to 'pay them back' however the application _proccesses can be lengthy and competitive_. 


_Crowd sourcing_ is a form of funding that comes from a large group of people all investing a small amount of income to reach a larger total. Crowd sourcing works best for _customer facing_ 'simple products' that solve a simple problem. Crowd sourcing is _not good for larger companies_ with technical and complex solutions or ones that aren't in the basic customer domain I.E business to business. Crowd sourcing is very good for seed businesses as the small investment means a the risk is offset to investors. 

// TODO: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE VENTURE CAPITALIST DEFINITION RIGHT, IT SOUNDS A LOT LIKE A BUSINESS ANGEL AND YOU DON'T WANT TO GET THOSE TWO MIXED UP. 


####As a __venture capitalist__, what criteria would you use to evaluate an __investment opportunity__ (10 marks)

A Venture capitalist is usually an individual investor that looks to take equity in a company in return for a stake of the business returns. Venture capatilists are open to large risks in order to achieve higher returns and will work closely with the organisation in order to achieve this. 

_Relationship to owners_ is important as the VC will work closely with the business and the venture capatilist has to be sure that the owners are the correct type of people to compliment their personality type. 

_Evidence of bootstrapping_ is important, the organisation must prove that it has some market need and that it is now gaining traction. Venture capitalists will tend not to invest in seedling companies as they are too risky. 

_ROI_ is another big factor for VC's. Since they are investing in mostly small companies with large sums of money, the VC must have potential reward to offset the risk. The risk is particularly high as small companies often do not have much to offset the investment. 

_Exit strategy_ is another big factor for VC's. It is the way that a VC will 'cash out' on its investment. A VC hopes to sell its equity in the company in 3-7 years, ideally in the IPO of the company.

####Discuss why the __UK's innovative performance__ appears to be, at best, average compare to its major competitors (DTI innovation report 2003). Incude in your answer what measures the government has taken to address this problem. (25 marks)

_The report_: Initiated by Tony Blair and with integration with Micheal Porter

The main reason that Britains innovative performance was not as good as other countries was due to lag in productivity per hour. 

// THIS IS NOT THE REAL REASON ... FIND IT OUT

Some steps that the government are taking to tackle issues identified in the report are:

_Skills_: The government will look to invest more in skills that support innovative behaviour, inclusive of higher education. 
_Skills_: Ensure the economy has the correct skills to support innovative behaviour
_Supporting innovation_: Advisory services, development of flexible leadership and management programmes
_Supporting women entrepreneurs_: Improve business advice, mentoring and networking
_Changing national measurements_: NMS (National measurement system) will be improved so that it reflects innovation more greatly.

####Small firm performance is not improved by __formal business training__ provided for entrepreneurs. Discuss this statement (10 marks) (3 occurences)

-  (Barber et al) Identifies Lack of management training and qualifications as a barrier to growth. 

`Entrepreneurial traits or attributes may be cultivated through education and training which itself should be enterprising in nature` (Carr, 2000)

`To develop a 'right hand person' to whom the manager can turn to, is a sign of operating proficiency` (Chell, 2001)

`Bringing other people to take on the responsibilities which had hitherto been dealt by the manager is a problem` (Chell, 2001)

* As an organisation grows, a good entrepreneur will be able to identify those with the prerequisite skills and willingness to take on higher responsibilities that could further the business. 

* As the SME will struggle to pay large wages, poaching is a concern and a reason for not investing in formal business training. 
	* Must counter with responsibility, progression and manage the culture so that it is an attractive place to work
	* Must manage satisfaction to lower labour turnover

####Discuss why use of __cognitive theory__ rather than describing __personality traits__ may give us a better understanding of why people engage in __entrepreneurial behaviour__? (10 marks) (3 occurences)

Personality trait analysis assumes that an entrepreneur cannot take the Kirzen based approach whereby an entrepreneur can possess any characteristics and still be an entrepreneur by exploiting market gaps. 

####Why is adopting __innovative culture__ so difficult for small businesses and how might they address this difficulty? (20 marks)

Innovative culture is generally most effective in small businesses if the _market conditions_ permit such behaviour and can be argued to exist mostly in niche markets. The markets that are best are usually where the market values product variety and producer flexibility  _(Deakins and Freel, 2003)_. 

Locating in a _'porterian cluster'_ can help to increase a firms ability to be innovative. By being around other related firms in a geographic cluster can help to foster and develop new innovative ideas _(Porter, 1990)_.

`Internationally competitive businesses are usually found in geographically concentrated clusters of related businesses` (Porter 1990)

- British opinion of failure

- Addressing the difficulty: 
	- `Social aspects of a cluster of companies lead to increased productivity in three ways: increased productivity, innovation, stimulating new business` - (Porter, 1990)




####Describe how you would take a __new product__ or service idea to the __market__ (25 marks)

When taking a product to market, consideration of _strategy_ must be taken. Deciding on a strategy must be defined before entering the market. Porter outlines 4 different strategies dependent on the price and the differentiation of the product. The firm must choose a strategy in order to be successful, not choosing a strategy could be highly detrimental.
