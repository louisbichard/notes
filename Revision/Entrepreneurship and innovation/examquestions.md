=====================

####With reference to the __key stages__ involved in the __innovative process__ and barriers you are likely to encounter?

The innovative process is defined as:

	Create ideas -> Select best idea -> Implement

However in some cases is extended as

	Recognition -> Invention -> Development -> Implementation -> Diffusion

In the selection phase:

__Subject area knowledge__: Closely linked to time, an entrepreneur must spend the time learning the market for which they want to enter and assessing the risks and balancing and addressing issues that exist across their varying products.

Most of the barriers that the entrepreneur will encounter will be within the implementation phase as this is when an entrepreneur must make the most risk, financially and personally. 

__Financials__ are a barrier to implementation of a small firm. As a seed company, an entrepreneur will need to look for investments from friends and family and invest their own capital as the idea hasn't yet been taken to market and therefore will struggle for formal investment in the forms of venture capital, or bank finance. 

__Time__: Most of these ideas will be born by employees in an industry who notice an opportunity and want to turn it into a business, they will however struggle to find the amount of time necessary to invest into a business to research the idea and bring it to market. 

__The external environment__: The market conditions must support then entrepreneurs business, the competition must be scalable, or the niche must be differentiated enough to gain market share. 

####With reference to their advantages and disadvantages, describe __economic measures of innovation__? (20)

* Measuring numbers of small businesses reflects the amount of replicative innovators that are in the economy - as defined by Schumpter. Egypt often comes out more entrepreneurial than America (Henrekson) when using this statistic. Henrekson also argued that self-made billionaires produces a much better measurement of entrepreneurial vigor in an economy. Small businesses are a sign of stagnation in the economy as no other jobs are available, successful businesses tend to destroy the smaller companies as they take up the market: I.e Walmart or Amazon. However this has implications.

* Entrepreneurs tend to be highly educated, 45% of american self-made entrepreneurs have advanced degrees. This is different to how it was at the start of the 1900's with engineers like Henry Ford dropping out of school. The service economy is king. 

####What do you understand to be the __'S curve'__ in relation to the introduction of a new product or service? (5 marks) (2 occurrences)

The 'S-curve' in relation to the release of a new product is the time taken for adoption from different categories of people and closely resembles and reflects the product lifecycle. 

The S curve is plotted in terms of adoption rate in the market (y axis) and time (x axis) and forms an S shape due to the slow adoption, followed by exponential growth, stagnation and eventually decline. 

In order of adoption, the 5 groups are: 

* Innovators
* Early adopters
* Early majority
* Early minority
* Laggards

####How can the __'Theory of planned behaviour'__ be used to explain entrepreneurial behaviour? (20 marks)

The theory of planned behaviour is a psychological tool that is used to predict the __likelihood that a person will partake in a specific act or behaviour__. The theory of planned behaviour is broken down into 6 main constructs that all determine someones behaviour. It should also be highlighted that a lot of the areas are to do with the entrepreneurs __perception__ of the situation, not just the actual situation itself. The theory however does not plan in different elements of behaviour intention such as mood, fear or past antecedent experience. 

__Attitude__ can affect an entrepreneurs behaviour, where the entrepreneur has a favourable evaluation of their behaviour of interest for instance, is the project a worthy cause? Will the entrepreneur earn enough money to live? Is it ethical (if the entrepreneur is likely to consider ethics).

__Subjective Norms__ refer to the perceptions of those around the entrepreneur. It is likely that if an entrepeneur speaks to their parents, they will want to entrepreneur to be safe and stable and not take risks, however if the entrepreneur is in social groups where entrepreneurial risky behaviour is normal, they are likely to conduct these behaviours. 

__Social norms__ refers to the customary codes of behaviour within the society within which the entrepreneur resides. Different countries have different likelhihoods of entrepreneurial behaviour and this is related to the social norm of those societies. In some socities where it is customary for a woman to stay at home and do house work are less likely to participate in entrepreneurial behaviour. 

__Behavioural control__ refers to the perception that the entrepreneur has over the situation. Are they smart enough, do they have the right resources etc. 

####What do you understand to be the finance gap? (5 marks)

Also known as the funding gap. The finance gap is the gap in provision for medium sized, fast growing firms. This occurs when the company is too large to ask individual shareholders for funds or to ask for bank finance but they are also not ready to launch on the stock market. 

####What barriers to __firm growth__ are often encountered by the entrepreneur (10 marks)

When assessing firms growth this can be done well through use of a PESTEL analysis to address the business positioning. 

__Political__: implications to growth could include goverment support, and therefore access to grants and financing. 

__Environmental__: A large consideration and could mean the competitors already in the market and their organisational structure. It may be that the market will not facilitate new competitors as it is already saturated, and larger companies will resist attempts to grow through cut price strategies, leveraging their own _economies of scale_. Furthermore as argued by Bridge et al (2003) growth cannot occur without innovation and the company will most likely need innovative new products in order to gain growth and market share. Similar to the _storey_ frameowork of growth, the organisations strategy is important to growth. The organisation must have direction and a vision for the markets they are targeting. 

__Social__ factors, again similar to `the entrepreneur` factor in _storey's_ (1994) theory of staged growth the entrepreneur must possess the right skills to create growth in the organisation. Skills such as the attitude to want to grow as Bridge et al (2003) identifies, some entrepreneurs do not want to grow their firm anymore as percieved benefits do not outweight the costs and thus the entrepreneur is in (as Bridge refers to it 'the comfort zone'.

__Economical__: Lastly economical factors such as the cash flow available to the organisation or their access to capital and financing will influence growth.

####__Opportunity spotting__ and idea creation is an essential part of the innovation process. How do entrepreurs identify new product and or service opportunities (25 marks)

Entrepreneurs may find opportunities in 3 main areas, gaps in the market, technological innovations or by looking into the future. 

Market opportunities can be identified a number of different ways, the first and most obvious being by having a __keen entrepreneurial eye__ within the indutstry. Secondly, using __market intelligence__ tools can also __detect changes in customer demands__ by measuring and analysing figures regarding the size, shape and dynamics of the market. Entrepreneurs can also use the __schumpeter replicator theory__ of the entrepreneur to copy existing organisations in the instance of __southwest airlines__ being copied by Stelios, but given a USP such as reduced travel agents to provide a low cost airline that met market demands. 

Secondly, opportunities can be found in __technological innovations__. This can sometimes be known as __'blue skies research'__ which refers to the act of researching technologies that aren't immediately apparent. This however can be very risky and expensive for an entrepreneur. 

Lastly, opportunities can be found in the future space. Predicting future changes is based on trends or __PESTLE analysis__ that analyses political, environmental, social, technological and economic changes in the businesses domain.

####Growth of a business is highly complex and depends on the interaction of different factors. Evaluate the Storey Framework as a way of identifiying firms that are likely to achieve a high level of growth (20 marks) (2 occurences)

The storey framework __consists of measuring 3 characteristics__ to predict growth: __The entrepreneur__, __the strategy__ they employ and __the company itself__. It is argued that these __factors are not independent__ and must all be present at the correct level in order for a business to be deemed in a position to achieve large rates of growth. 

The first characteristic is that of the entrepreneur themselves which encompasses factors regarding the entrepreneur themselves and whether they are deemed to possess the relevant characteristics and skills in order to drive growth. Some examples of these characteristics are __motivation__, __education__, __Management experiencee__. 

Secondly is the factors of __the company__ itself. The company encompasses usually decisions by the entrepreneur when they set up the organisation and remain fairly constant once they start trading. This is measured by addressing factors such as the __companies age__, __culture__ and __structure__. 

Lastly is __the strategy__ of the organistation itself which is arguably the most important and interesting characteristic. Includes factors such as the market position of the company, training of the workforce, any new products it has in the pipeline and competitors.

####How does the __schumpeterian__ view of the entrepreneur differ with that of kirzner? (15 marks) (3 occurences)

Schumpeter was an economist, who thought that entrepreneurs were someone special who was innately creative. Yet this creativity would only flourish in an economically stable environment. 

Schumpeter defined two types of entrepreneur: Those who were replicators of existing ideas and tended to setup small businesses and those who were innovators who would crash into a market, and disrupt the common zeitgeist to push new boundaries and develop and push new ideas. 

Kirzner on the other hand believed that entrepreneurs were opportunitists, taking advantage of holes in the market, as opposed to being innately innovative or creative, kirzner believed that entrepreneurs were more business minded than creative and had the insight and knowledge to notice these market needs and implement them.

####With reference to the main types of __intellectual property__ describe how inventors can protect their ideas. In each case briefly explain the process for securing intellectual property rights on an idea (20 marks)

Intellectual property is non-physical property that is the product of original thought. Intellectual property allow artists and creators to gain rights to prosecute those infringing their rights by copying their ideas. 

__Patents__ are a type of intellectual property that protects inventions with regards to what they do and how they achieve it, including what they are made of etc. Applicatin for a patent must be done through the patent office for the region that it is to be registered. The process involves filing the patent for review (known as __patent pending__) and the office must decide whether to abandon or grant the patent. The idea must be original and not currently known to the public, known as __prior art__ (pre-existing knowledge of the idea in the public domain). The patent will then last 20 years and can be licensed or sold. 

__Design rights__ are protection over the look or appearance of a certain object, or part of an object applying to 2D objects, colours, shapes, contours etc. Design rights must be registered and paid for and then last for 20 years.

####Describe the main sources of __debt and equity finance__ for entrepreneurs and reflect on the advantages of __funding a business__ through different routes (15 marks) (2 occurences)

__Banks__ will invest in businesses, however will be reluctant to do so in the case of small businesses. Banks can provide large sources of funding, but there will be little feedback and assistance. Banks are primarily bothered about __ROI__ and finances. 

__Venture capitalists__ will invest in small companies (however not seeds) and are more open to taking risk if the reward can be seen. Venture capitalists are often likely to invest in indivduals as they will need to work with them, and often they are investing in the businesses ability to generate ideas, rather than on one sole investment. 

__Grants__ are usually government funding 'pots' of money available to certain business types. Grants are advantageous in that you do not have to 'pay them back' however the application __proccesses can be lengthy and competitive__. 


__Crowd sourcing__ is a form of funding that comes from a large group of people all investing a small amount of income to reach a larger total. Crowd sourcing works best for __customer facing__ 'simple products' that solve a simple problem. Crowd sourcing is __not good for larger companies__ with technical and complex solutions or ones that aren't in the basic customer domain I.E business to business. Crowd sourcing is very good for seed businesses as the small investment means a the risk is offset to investors. 

// TODO: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE VENTURE CAPITALIST DEFINITION RIGHT, IT SOUNDS A LOT LIKE A BUSINESS ANGEL AND YOU DON'T WANT TO GET THOSE TWO MIXED UP. 


####As a __venture capitalist__, what criteria would you use to evaluate an __investment opportunity__ (10 marks)

A Venture capitalist is usually an individual investor that looks to take equity in a company in return for a stake of the business returns. Venture capatilists are open to large risks in order to achieve higher returns and will work closely with the organisation in order to achieve this. 

__Relationship to owners__ is important as the VC will work closely with the business and the venture capatilist has to be sure that the owners are the correct type of people to compliment their personality type. 

__Evidence of bootstrapping__ is important, the organisation must prove that it has some market need and that it is now gaining traction. Venture capitalists will tend not to invest in seedling companies as they are too risky. 

__ROI__ is another big factor for VC's. Since they are investing in mostly small companies with large sums of money, the VC must have potential reward to offset the risk. The risk is particularly high as small companies often do not have much to offset the investment. 

__Exit strategy__ is another big factor for VC's. It is the way that a VC will 'cash out' on its investment. A VC hopes to sell its equity in the company in 3-7 years, ideally in the IPO of the company.

####Small firm performance is not improved by __formal business training__ provided for entrepreneurs. Discuss this statement (10 marks) (3 occurences)


`Entrepreneurial traits or attributes may be cultivated through education and training which itself should be enterprising in nature` (Carr, 2000)

`To develop a 'right hand person' to whom the manager can turn to, is a sign of operating proficiency` (Chell, 2001)

`Bringing other people to take on the responsibilities which had hitherto been dealt by the manager is a problem` (Chell, 2001)

* As an organisation grows, a good entrepreneur will be able to identify those with the prerequisite skills and willingness to take on higher responsibilities that could further the business. 

* As the SME will struggle to pay large wages, poaching is a concern and a reason for not investing in formal business training. 
	* Must counter with responsibility, progression and manage the culture so that it is an attractive place to work
	* Must manage satisfaction to lower labour turnover
