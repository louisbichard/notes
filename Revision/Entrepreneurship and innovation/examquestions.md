##Section 2 questions (back to 2008)

###General innovation

####What do you understand to be the 'S curve' in relation to the introduction of a new product or service? (5 marks) (2 occurrences)

The 'S-curve' in relation to the release of a new product is the time taken for adoption from different categories of people and closely resembles and reflects the product lifecycle. 

The S curve is plotted in terms of adoption rate in the market (y axis) and time (x axis) and forms an S shape due to the slow adoption, followed by exponential growth, stagnation and eventually decline. 

In order of adoption, the 5 groups are: 

* Innovators
* Early adopters
* Early majority
* Early minority
* Laggards

###Opportunities

####Opportunity spotting and idea creation is an essential part of the innovation process. How do entrepreurs identify new product and or service opportunities (25 marks)

Entrepreneurs may find opportunities in 3 main areas, gaps in the market, technological innovations or by looking into the future. 

Market opportunities can be identified a number of different ways, the first and most obvious being by having a __keen entrepreneurial eye__ within the indutstry. Secondly, using __market intelligence__ tools can also __detect changes in customer demands__ by measuring and analysing figures regarding the size, shape and dynamics of the market. Entrepreneurs can also use the __schumpeter replicator theory__ of the entrepreneur to copy existing organisations in the instance of __southwest airlines__ being copied by Stelios, but given a USP such as reduced travel agents to provide a low cost airline that met market demands. 

Secondly, opportunities can be found in __technological innovations__. This can sometimes be known as __'blue skies research'__ which refers to the act of researching technologies that aren't immediately apparent. This however can be very risky and expensive for an entrepreneur. 

Lastly, opportunities can be found in the future space. Predicting future changes is based on trends or __PESTLE analysis__ that analyses political, environmental, social, technological and economic changes in the businesses domain.

###People - Entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship

####How can the 'Theory of planned behaviour' be used to explain entrepreneurial behaviour? (20 marks)

####Discuss why use of cognitive theory rather tahn describing personality traits may give us a better understanding of why people engage in entrepreneurial behaviour? (10 marks) (3 occurences)

####How does the schumpeterian view of the entrepreneur differ with that of kirzner? (15 marks) (3 occurences)

Schumpeter was an economist, who thought that entrepreneurs were someone special who was innately creative. Yet this creativity would only flourish in an economically stable environment. 

Schumpeter defined two types of entrepreneur: Those who were replicators of existing ideas and tended to setup small businesses and those who were innovators who would crash into a market, and disrupt the common zeitgeist to push new boundaries and develop and push new ideas. 

Kirzner on the other hand believed that entrepreneurs were opportunitists, taking advantage of holes in the market, as opposed to being innately innovative or creative, kirzner believed that entrepreneurs were more business minded than creative and had the insight and knowledge to notice these market needs and implement them.

###Measuring innovation

####Briefly describe how you would evaluate the success of a new government funding scheme available to encourage innovation in small businesses (5 marks) (5 occurences)

####Discuss why the UK's innovative performance appears to be, at best, average compare to its major competitors (DTI innovation report 2003). Incude in your answer what measure the government has taken to address this problem. (25 marks)

####With reference to their advantages and disadvantages, describe economic measures of innovation? (20)

* Measuring numbers of small businesses reflects the amount of replicative innovators that are in the economy - as defined by Schumpter. Egypt often comes out more entrepreneurial than America (Henrekson) when using this statistic. Henrekson also argued that self-made billionaires produces a much better measurement of entrepreneurial vigor in an economy. Small businesses are a sign of stagnation in the economy as no other jobs are available, successful businesses tend to destroy the smaller companies as they take up the market: I.e Walmart or Amazon. However this has implications.

* Entrepreneurs tend to be highly educated, 45% of american self-made entrepreneurs have advanced degrees. This is different to how it was at the start of the 1900's with engineers like Henry Ford dropping out of school. The service economy is king.
