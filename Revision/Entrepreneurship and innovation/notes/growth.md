##Supporting growth in SME's
- Knowledge transfer opportunities
- Training

##The use of clusters for businesses


# Business lifecycle
================

Birth -> Survival -> Growth/ Take off -> Maturity -> Resource Maturity

# Models of growth
==================

## Greiner model of growth

- Posits a linear continuous relationship between time and growth
- Periodic defined crisises
- Each period of evolution has a clear set of attributes to characterise it and each stage which ultimately degenerates into crisis is a solution to the crisis of the previous stage.

### Crisises

__Crisis of leadership__: More sophisticated knowledge and competencies are required to operate larger production runs and manage an expanding workforce. Capital must be secured to underpin further growth. Must hire additional executive resource and restructure. 

__Crisis of autonomy__: The control mechanisms implemented as a result of the first crisis become less appropriate as the physical size of the company increases. Liine employees and managers become frustrated with the beauracracy attendent. Staff become torn between following procedures or taking initiative. Company must delegate to alow decision making. 

__Crisis of control__: Top executives begin to percieve a loss of control. Little coordination across divisions. Top management must seek to gain control through use of special coordination techniques. 

__Crisis of red tape__: Line managers object to excessive direction and senior management view line managers as unco-operative and disruptive Become too large and complex to be managed through an extensive framework of formal procedures.

## Churchill model of growth

// TODO: RESERACH AS THE SLIDES JUST SHOWED THE GRAPH ( NOT SO USEFUL )

### Storey characteristics approach model
- Storey (1994) said that the Churchill and Greiner models only describe, but do not measure growth
- Theory consists of 3 characteristics
- Often drawn as a venn diagram as the concepts are overlapping
- Must combine all characteristics in order to achieve growth 
- 

###The entrepreneur
- A lot of these elements can be addressed before the business exists as they are related to the entrepreneur as an individual
- Rely on the entrepreneurs access to resources no the business
- Factors: 
	- Motivation
	- Education
	- Management experience
	- Social marginality
	- Functional skills
	- Age
	- Gender

	- Technological sophistication
	- Planning
	- New products
	- Competition
	- Planning and financial strategy

###Company
- Reflect decisions made by the entrepreneur when starting the firm
