#Indicators of growth
=====================
- Revenue
- Profit
- Share prices (PLC)
- Staff
- Knowledge
- Scale of operation

##Supporting growth in SME's
- Knowledge transfer opportunities
- Training
	- Task oriented: Planning, finances
	- Mentoring style assistance
	- Growth vouchers
	- Storey and Westhead (1996)
		- Little evidence between formal training and improved performance
		- Personal management development training appears to have no impact on performance
- Mentoring
- Clustering
	- `Internationally competitive businesses are usually found in geographically concentrated clusters of related businesses` (Porter 1990)
- Financial support

##Initiatives for start up and growth
- Encouraging student placements
- University business schools to offer support to

##Networking to improve entrepreneurial skills
- Gibb (1997)
	- Proposes that the development of the entrepreneur is affected by the extent of interaction with stakeholders in the small firm environment
	- Teaching networking therefore improves entrepreneurial skills?

# Models of growth
==================

## Greiner model of growth

- Posits a linear continuous relationship between time and growth
- Periodic defined crisises
- Each period of evolution has a clear set of attributes to characterise it and each stage which ultimately degenerates into crisis is a solution to the crisis of the previous stage.
- Defines triggers between each stage.

### Crisises

_Phase 1: Creativity_

__Crisis of leadership__: More sophisticated knowledge and competencies are required to operate larger production runs and manage an expanding workforce. Capital must be secured to underpin further growth. Must hire additional executive resource and restructure. 

_Phase 2: Direction_

__Crisis of autonomy__: The control mechanisms implemented as a result of the first crisis become less appropriate as the physical size of the company increases. Liine employees and managers become frustrated with the beauracracy attendent. Staff become torn between following procedures or taking initiative. Company must delegate to alow decision making. 

_Phase 3: Delegation_

__Crisis of control__: Top executives begin to percieve a loss of control. Little coordination across divisions. Top management must seek to gain control through use of special coordination techniques. 

_Phase 4: Co-ordination_

__Crisis of red tape__: Line managers object to excessive direction and senior management view line managers as unco-operative and disruptive Become too large and complex to be managed through an extensive framework of formal procedures.

_Phase 5: Collaboration_

__?__: Greiner does not define a sixth crisis

## Churchill model of growth

- Although commenting on greiners model
- A more gneeral depiction of growth models where transition from stage to stage has no explicit trigger

_Phase 1: Existence_
_Phase 2: Survival_
_Phase 3 a: Success disengagement_
_Phase 3 b: Success growth_
_Phase 4: Take off_
_Phase 5: Maturity_

### Storey characteristics approach model
- Theory consists of 3 characteristics
- Often drawn as a venn diagram as the concepts are overlapping
- Must combine all characteristics in order to achieve growth 

`Churchill and Greiner models only describe, but do not measure growth` Storey (1994)

###The entrepreneur
- A lot of these elements can be addressed before the business exists as they are related to the entrepreneur as an individual
- Rely on the entrepreneurs access to resources no the business
- Factors such as: Motivation, education, management experience, functional skills, age & gender

###Strategy
- Are arguably the most important
- Factors: Market positioning, planning, technological sophistication, competition, new products in pipeline

###Company 
- Reflect decisions made by the entrepreneur when starting the firm
- Generally held constant when trading begins
- Factors: Age, type, culture, structure
