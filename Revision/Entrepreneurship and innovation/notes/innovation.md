##Â Schumpeters forces of creative destruction

1. The introduction of a new good, or significant improve on existing good
2. New method of production
3. Opening of a new market
4. New source of raw materials
5. Creation of a new type of organisation

# Innovation and firm size
===========================

- Is largely limited to niche industries that are not a concern for large companies
- Depends on the market
- Do well in industries that place a premium on flexibility and resourcefulness

`Some markets value product variety and producer flexibility` (Deakins and Freel, 2003)

`Small firms enjoy innovative strategy in markets where innovation is high and R&D intensity is low` (Acs & Audretsch)

## Schumpeters different views

Initially suggested that innovation dervies from small organisations and single entrepreneurs

Also proposed that large firms are the creators of all innovations due to economies of scale and availability of finance for blue skies research.

## Rothwells views of innovation in small vs large firms

- Likely to depend on the age of the firm

## Legal protection of innovation

- Use of patents can help organistaions to create monopolistic market setups to allow recouperation of R&D costs (Dyson)
- Innovative as it is destructive by coming up with a new good that is significantly better (Schumpeter)

## Oslo manual
- OECD measure of innovation
- Collection and interpretation of data on innovation
- Benchmarking of national performance
- Small organisations are more specialised in their activities
- SME's lack finance to fund innovations

### Measurements: 
- Research and experimental development
	- Includes creating and testing a prototype
- Aquisition of knowledge or machinery: patents, licenses, trademarks or design patterns
- Activities for marketing and organisational innovations
- Design
- Development and use of software
