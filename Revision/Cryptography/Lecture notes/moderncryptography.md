#Design principles of modern symmetric block ciphers

* Mainly based on the ideas of Shannon (1945) and developed by Fiestel (1973)
* Hiding relation between ciphertext and the key


#Confusion and diffusion

##Definitions
__Confusion__: Hiding the relation between ciphertext and key
__Diffusion__: Spreading information. Small changes in cipher text should produce large changes in ciphertext

##Overview
* Usuaully achieved by a combination of _substitutions_ and _permutations_
* Substitutions ( S-BOX ) act on smaller groups of bits
* Permutations act over the whole block

###How it is achieved
* Is achieved by running several rounds, e.g. substitutions, permutations and XORing
* Bit block lengths can be up to 64-254 bits

#DES ( Data encryption standard )
* A symmetric key system
* Very fast
* Advances in comuting power made it vulnerable to exhaustive key search
* Was replaced by a new standard AES ( Advanced encryption standard )

##Cryptanalysis of DES
* Exhaustive key search succeded to crack DES in recent years
* Several DES cracking challenges resulted in brute force breaking of DES

##How to make DES stronger
* Triple DES
	* Encrypt using one key
	* Decrypt with another second key
	* Encrypt again using the first key (or a third)

#AES ( Advanced encryption standard )
* Consists of several rounds, each consisting of a combination of substitutions, permutations and XOR-ing with the round key
* All bits are treated equally and each round acts on all 
* Plain text is organised in a 4 x 4 array of bytes, called the state
* Successive bytes are written in column wise arrays

##Rounds of encryption
* __Byte sub__ ( An SBOX  ) is applied to each byte
* __ShiftRow__: Each row is cyclically shifted left by the offsets 0, 1, 2, 3 bytes
* __MixColumn__: Each column of bytes is transformed by a finite field operation ( can be viewed as a substitution acting on each column )
* __AddRoundKey__: The round key, written column wise is XOR'ed to the current block

##Rounds
* There is an XOR with a round key before the first round
* The last round skips the mixcolumns step


##RoundKey generation
Is done by expanding the original key

* Round keys are generated by expanding the original key
* Starts with the original key
* Geneartes 1 more 4 byte at a time
* Each word is an xor between the preceeding word and the word 4 positions back
* For every 4th word, another method is applied (Involves rotation of the word, and xor with a predefined value and substitution using S-BOX)
* Expanded key is split into round keys of the required size
