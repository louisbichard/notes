#Overview

##Cryptography vs Cryptanalysis

__Cryptography__: Secret communication i.e transforming a message in such a way that only the intended recipient can understand it. It should be unfeasible (too expensive or time consuming) for an eavesdropper to recover the original message. 

__Cryptanalysis__: "Code breaking" - recovering messages without the priviledged information (i.e the key). 

__Cryptology__: Cryptography + Cryptanalysis

##Types of attacks

	* Traffic analysis
* Active attacks
	* Tampering with the messages
	* Replay
	* Impersonation
	* Impersonating the sender and reciever (man in the middle)
