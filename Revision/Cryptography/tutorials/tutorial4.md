# Compute gcd(15879, 3927).

15879   = 3927 × 4 + 171
3927    = 171 × 22 + 165
171     = 165 × 1 + 6
165     = 6 × 27 + 3
6       = 3 × 2 + 0

Hence, gcd(15879, 3927) = 3

# Which elements of the set of integers modulo 40 (i.e. Z40) have multiplicative inverses? Compute the inverses of at least four of them. Use the extended Euclidean algorithm to compute the inverse of 7 modulo 40.

# Alice and Bob use the RSA public key cryptosystem. For his keys Bob chooses the prime numbers p = 5, q = 11 and the encryption exponent e = 7.

## Compute Bob’s public key and private key.

##Alice wants to send Bob the messages 5, 12 and 25. How will she encrypt the messages? 

## How will Bob decrypt the messages he received from Alice? Use the square-and multiply method in at least one of the decryptions.

## Bob now wants to send an unencrypted message to Alice but he wants to sign it. He applies a public hash function to his unencrypted message and obtains the message digest 13. What will be his signature?

## How can Alice verify Bob’s signature?
