# Notes 

- Pull supply chain:
    - You need to have a low lead time, you need to be able to get stock in soon
    - Need to be able to trust the suppliers
    - Use a JIT system
    - More agile process
    - Can help facilitate a 'Kanban' process
    - Will still require buffer stock
- Often ERP goes wrong and the systems fail
    + Goods and raw materials not able to purchase properly
    + Hard to implement
    + Are very very complicated
