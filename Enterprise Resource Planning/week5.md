- The accounting part of the system will take note of changes for instance in resource changes, such as when more time is taken to create a component, this time wasted is tracked and used to calculate financial costs of each components
    + Can then be used to create averages for pricing strategies
    + Creates transparency over costs
    + Shows anomolous costings and can build in prevention methods
