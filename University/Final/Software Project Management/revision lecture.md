##Tips for answering questions

###Don't brain dump
* Not putting down all the information that you know, but answering the extended answer specifically
	* When drawing a process model for instance, don't draw unnecessary additional diagrams if they aren't related to the quesiton itself

###Time based tips
* Allocate time effectively and don't spend too long on smaller questions
	* 2 or 3 mark questions are only around 10 minutes worth of work

###Planning

* Plan all questions before you go ahead

###Process
* Looking for more correct answers that nooone will have thought of ... the more edgecase and obscure answers that others won't seemingly have thought of
* If the question is worth 5 marks, if they are all high level points, then you will not get the 5 marks. All the points must be of varying degrees of complexity
* Looking for outside reading on the subject

###Specific question answering
* Spending more time on questions has diminishing returns, don't spend too long on answers if you've already written a lot

###References
* Add references into your answers

###Chris' marking preference
* Chris literally loves bullet points, just use them
* Adds points and marks for each individual point, make points clear and defined to make it easy for him to give you marks

###Drawing graphs
* If it says to draw a graph, simply draw the graph, don't write additional content unless something is significantly unclear and requires additional notes, but don't waste unnecessary time
*
