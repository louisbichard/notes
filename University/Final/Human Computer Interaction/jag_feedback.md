I will just provide some high level feedback. If some of it sounds super critical, I'm sorry! :P Also, this is just my opinion, feel free to disagree, it's up for debate! I've not really gone into detail about how we can change the wording as such, because I have some feedback regarding the layout which I think will change the way the content is written slightly, so can provide feedback to that after the formatting is addressed?

# Positives
- Most of the 'content' alongside each image is really good
- Really easy to follow
- I like the break down of each view, really shows deep thinking about the users journey
- Like the intro to the gestures, and I really like the hand icons, they help to paint a nice picture
- The whole concept of the anatomy of the view is really really cool, great idea whoever came up with that. 

# Criticisms

## Top level view
Tom made a high level view of how all the views fit together semantially, it would be nice to get this in there to give an overview before the walkthrough begins, just to 'set the scene' :P 

## Use of text boxes
A little pedantic, but concerned for this in regards to word counts and formatting issues down the line? Not sure if you share my concerns for this, but a consideration

## Formatting
I like the hand drawings but think we could make a couple of changes
 
- Break each section of text down into the key areas: Contextual, Global etc. So that each area has a little overview (however only if necessary) for each hand drawing, and from this, we can have some arrows and boxes to make it a little easier for the reader to digest the information. (Like the first one that hedges applied some colours too)

- I think each input where it's a push or scroll where necessary would benefit from having the 'gesture hand' overlayed ontop of it so that you can get a better feel for how the user would interact with the system. Gestures are hard to mock and I think this would give a nice feel to the walkthrough. 

## Analysis
- I think we could go into a bit more than description on each wireframe. Rather than saying what it is, more of why it's like that. At the moment it's  like 
    
    `the shop button is on the left` 

and I think we could try to move this more to:

    `The shop button is on the left for easy navigation for the user, after previously considering XYZ and our research blah`

However, I'll be happy to go through this when we have a look at the formatting
